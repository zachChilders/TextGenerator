In case you’re not familiar with the finer points of threat assessment within the national security apparatus, the NIE is the big enchilada: the document seen by presidents and members of Congress; an objective, non-political, comprehensive piece of work that categorizes and prioritizes the threats faced by the United States.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.I’ve developed my own amateur NIE based on this information, and here’s the organization at the top of the list:The Republican Party. Shocking as that may seem — and your level of shock may vary widely depending on how closely you’ve been tracking the actions both center stage and behind the scenes of the rapidly toxifying Grand Ole Party — the real problem with this revelation is that we cannot actually do much about this threat in the classic manner. The threat from the right is the first national-level “insider threat” the United States has faced since the Civil War. It is insidious, asymmetric, powerful – and existential. How did I come to this conclusion? Through empirical evidence and specialized experience, using the same approach as when I helped draft a document seen by the most powerful men and women in the country. One of the effective modern techniques we’ve developed to deal with threats is intelligence analysis – in which we methodically examine all potential threats and categorize them for effective response.  Categorizations range from existential – such as that from thermonuclear war with the Soviet Union or global warming – to challenging – such as terrorism – to those of a merely nuisance variety. The NIE, like all intelligence products, is supposed to be: objective; non-political; current; empirically valid; and zero-based (starting without assumptions.)A part of categorization or as a next step is threat prioritization – in which we basically rank the range of threats we face so we can apply limited resources to bring down the risk. This is a necessary action, but one that is often not totally satisfactory to all citizens.  For instance, the shift we’ve had to take in response to terrorism – from total elimination of the threat to limiting its potential impact — does not appear to many Americans as a proportional response to the problem.  Nonetheless, from the resource and policy perspective, it is the right course of action.   Let me say it again: the Republican Party is the biggest threat the United States is facing. And without proper attribution, recognition, and a well-articulated and implemented counter-strategy, it could be terminal. There is no other reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts. An enemy of the United States might seek to sow discord between ethnic groups, or to wage a disinformation campaign, or to highlight moral inconsistencies that weaken the standing of the United States on the world stage. An enemy of the United States might try and degrade the capacity and public trust within our intelligence apparatus. It might use propaganda and weaponized  information. It might seek to engage in fraud or other criminal acts to sway an election in their favor. Does any of that sound familiar? The Republican Party has steadily embraced authoritarianism, suspect electoral tactics, and racism more and more over the past few decades. That process has been turbocharged with Trump at the helm of the party.We’re now seeing an explicit embrace of white supremacy. Denial in the face of climate change. Deliberate sowing of discord within the FBI and the CIA. Weakening of the rule of law. Brazen criminality. Removing funding for elections oversight. Blatant human rights abuses at the border. The explicit nature of these acts is the point. The Republicans mean to bludgeon any and all resistance to their reshaping of the nation’s institutions to their will. And so far, they’ve gotten away with it. Donald Trump and his coterie of criminals have done more in two years to weaken the United States than the Soviet Union was able to achieve in decades, a stolen gold medal in Olympic basketball notwithstanding. In other words, Americans have every right to fear the power and influence of the Republican Party – and it is in fact irrational to continue to downplay the threat even as most, including Nancy Pelosi and many Democrats, continue to do so.

Watch VICE News Tonight on HBO weekdays at 7:30.WASHINGTON — A federal judge ordered the release of documents related to the investigation into hush money payments to women claiming they slept with President Trump. The documents must be posted by 11:00 am eastern on Thursday, July 18, Judge William H. Pauley of the Southern District of New York wrote in a decision released Wednesday. “The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance.

WASHINGTON — A federal judge ordered the release of documents related to the investigation into hush money payments to women claiming they slept with President Trump. The documents must be posted by 11:00 am eastern on Thursday, July 18, Judge William H. Pauley of the Southern District of New York wrote in a decision released Wednesday. “The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance. Now that the Government's investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the Materials,” Judge Pauley wrote. Read: Michael Cohen implicated Trump in at least 11 different feloniesPauley ordered prosecutors release the Justice Department’s July status report and search warrant materials related to raids on President Trump’s jailed former attorney, Michael Cohen, be posted online. In his ruling Wednesday, Pauley rejected the government’s request to redact portions of the documents, citing “the weighty public ramifications of the conduct described.”Federal officials told the judge they have completed their investigation into the matter. Federal prosecutors wrote in December that President Trump coordinated and directed payments that bought the silence of two women who claimed they’d had affairs with him, although they referred to him as “Individual-1.” “Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,” SDNY prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo for Cohen. Cohen later confirmed, during sworn Congressional testimony, that “Individual-1 is President Donald J. Trump.” Cohen pleaded guilty to his role in the campaign finance violations, among other financial crimes, and began serving a three-year sentence in May. In rejecting the government’s request to redact the documents to protect third-party privacy interests, Judge Pauley wrote that “the involvement of most of the relevant third-party actors is now public knowledge, undercutting the need for continued secrecy.”The names of some of Cohen’s business partners in the New York taxi industry, law enforcement officials and one “uncharged-third party” referred to in a footnote could be redacted, the judge wrote. But the rest has to be released to the public. Judge Pauley’s order comes a week before special counsel Robert Mueller is due to testify for several hours before two Democrat-controlled committees in the House of Representatives. Cohen was an early focus of Mueller’s probe into Trump’s connections to Russia and potential obstruction of justice. Documents already released in Cohen’s case showed that Mueller was interested in money flowing to Cohen’s bank accounts for consulting gigs Cohen landed after Trump took office. Read: Democrats Fought Hard for An Extra Hour With Mueller. How Much Does It Matter?Pauley’s order on Wednesday didn’t mention Trump — but made clear that he’s ordering the materials released because he believes the American public has a right to know what their elected officials have been up to.“Indeed, the common law right of access — a right so enshrined in our identity that it ‘predate[s] even the Constitution itself’ — derives from the public’s right to ‘learn of, monitor, and respond to the actions of their representatives and representative institutions,’” he wrote.Cover: President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Tuesday, July 16, 2019, in Washington.

Protester holding photos of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein interrupts rallyPhotographer tracks down negatives for couple who lost their wedding pictures in wildfireSeth Meyers mocks Republicans who would rather hide in elevators than criticize TrumpAfter raising rates, Netflix reports first-ever drop in U.S. subscribersCrowd at rally chants 'Send her back!' after Trump attacks Ilhan OmarThese are the 20 Democrats who qualified for CNN's debatesHouse votes to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contemptHouse kills Rep. Al Green's impeachment resolution after 332-95 voteProtester holding photos of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein interrupts rallyA protester armed with pictures of President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with the words "CHILD RAPIST" disrupted Trump's Wednesday night rally in Greenville, North Carolina.CNN reports that the man was "removed in a more aggressive manner than most protesters and pulled down behind a sign where he remained for a while as supporters took pictures." After the demonstrator was taken away with his hands behind his back, Trump said he was going "home now to mommy, and he gets reprimanded and that's the end."Epstein, a financier, was arrested earlier this month and charged by prosecutors in New York with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. More than a decade ago, Epstein was accused of sexually abusing girls, but pleaded guilty to felony prostitution charges instead and received a lenient 13-month jail sentence.In 2002, Trump told New York magazine, "I've known Jeff for 15 years, terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." After Epstein's arrest, Trump said he "knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him. I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you." Earlier on Wednesday, MSNBC aired footage from NBC's archives showing Trump and Epstein in 1992, laughing at a party. Trump appears to point at a woman and say "she's hot," and is also seen grabbing another woman in attendance. Catherine GarciaPhotographer tracks down negatives for couple who lost their wedding pictures in wildfireThis is an early 20th anniversary gift they'll never forget.When the Camp Fire swept through Grass Valley, California, last fall, it completely destroyed Marc and Mary Taylor's home. All of their possessions were lost in the wildfire, including decades worth of photos. Hoping she could recover some of them, Mary Taylor got in touch with the photographer, Richard Briggs, who shot their wedding on August 14, 1999.Briggs was thrilled when he started digging around and found the negatives, telling KCRA that usually, photographers don't keep them for so long. "Luckily, they were intact," he said. "They were a little faded. I bought a scanner and scanned them all. And my wife, she's excellent in editing, and she brought back the color and the life into the photos, and from those images, I was able to make an album." He can still recall the wedding, he added, and remembers thinking, "These people are so much in love."The Taylors cried when Briggs gave them not only their wedding album, but also the negatives, as these are the only photos they've been able to replace. "It gave us a piece of something back after losing everything," Marc Taylor said. "I don't know how to explain it. There's no words." Catherine GarciaSeth Meyers mocks Republicans who would rather hide in elevators than criticize TrumpOn Wednesday's Late Night, Seth Meyers took to task Republican leaders who are insisting that President Trump's "latest racist comments are not at all racist, despite the fact the they are definitely super racist."As everyone knows by now, on Sunday Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen of color should "go back" to their "crime infested" home countries. Three of the women were born in the United States, and the fourth arrived as a refugee from Somalia and is now a naturalized citizen. "If their country is broken and crime infested, that's on you," Meyers said. "Trump accidentally burned himself. It's like if someone said, 'Man your parents must have really screwed you up,' and that someone was your mom."Since posting the tweets, Trump has defended himself multiple times by accusing the women of saying "horrible things" and saying over and over again that anyone who isn't happy in the United States should leave. "Trump's brain disease won't let him backtrack, no matter how far over the line he goes," Meyers said. "If he says, 'I'm going to eat this apple,' and you said, 'Dude, that's an onion,' he would stand there and eat the whole thing with tears streaming down his face."Most of Meyers' ire went beyond Trump to Republican lawmakers who are bending over backwards not to comment on the situation, and he played a montage of some senators who fled to elevators to avoid having to speak to reporters. He also singled out Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who was a congressman during the Obama administration. In the new book American Carnage, author Tim Alberta writes that in 2016, Mulvaney said Republicans would not let "Donald Trump dismantle the Bill of Rights," and bristled at the idea that their constant pushback against Obama was racist, saying they would treat a president of their own party the same way. That's just not true, Meyers said, as Republicans "are literally hiding in elevators to avoid criticizing Trump." Watch the video below. Catherine GarciaAfter raising rates, Netflix reports first-ever drop in U.S. subscribersNetflix stock fell more than 10 percent after the market closed Wednesday, following the company's announcement that for the first time since launching its digital service eight years ago, it saw a drop in U.S. subscribers.In the second quarter, Netflix lost 126,000 paid U.S. subscribers, and also only added 2.7 million subscribers worldwide, far below the five million investors expected. With its hit show Stranger Things now streaming new episodes, Netflix expects to add more than seven million subscribers during the current quarter. Right now, there are more than 60 million U.S. subscribers.The market is getting more and more crowded, with Disney Plus and HBO Max set to enter the streaming world soon. In 2020, Friends, the second-most watched show on Netflix last year, will only be available to U.S. and Canadian customers on HBO Max. The Office is also leaving Netflix next year, as the show's owner, NBCUniversal, agreed to pay $100 million a year for the next five years in order to have streaming rights. Catherine GarciaCrowd at rally chants 'Send her back!' after Trump attacks Ilhan OmarPresident Trump continued to lob insults at four Democratic congresswomen, calling them out by name during a rally Wednesday night in North Carolina.On Sunday, he tweeted racist comments targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), saying they need to "go back" to their home countries. The lawmakers — all outspoken Trump critics and women of color — are fueling "the rise of a dangerous, hard left," Trump said Wednesday.After blasting Omar — who came to the U.S. from Somalia as a child and is a naturalized American citizen — and accusing her of "launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds," the crowd erupted in chants of "Send her back!" This not only echoed Trump's tweets, but also "Lock her up!" the longtime rallying cry of Trump supporters aimed at Hillary Clinton.Trump referred to Ocasio-Cortez as "Cortez" because "I don't have time to go with three different names," and said she is a liar and behind "outrageous attacks against the men and women of law enforcement." He also asked if Pressley is "related in any way to Elvis" (who spelled his last name with just one "s") and said she "thinks that people with the same skin color all need to think the same. She said we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be brown voices. ... Can you imagine if I said that? It would be over, right? It would be over." Catherine GarciaThese are the 20 Democrats who qualified for CNN's debatesThe Democratic National Committee announced on Wednesday which 2020 presidential candidates will take the stage during CNN's primary debates later this month.The candidates are: Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.); former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; New York Mayor Bill de Blasio; former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.); Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii); Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.); Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.); former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas); Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio); Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); author Marianne Williamson; and businessman Andrew Yang.As with the first debate in June, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass) and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam did not qualify for this round. Newcomers to the race Tom Steyer, a billionaire investor, and former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Penn.) also did not make the cut.The debates will be held in Detroit over two days: July 30 and 31, with both starting at 8 p.m. E.T. On Thursday night, CNN will hold a live drawing during Anderson Cooper 360 to determine the candidate lineup for each night. Catherine GarciaHouse votes to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contemptThe House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for their refusal to hand over subpoenaed documents related to the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.The 230-198 vote was along party lines. Before the vote, Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said he did "not take this decision lightly. Holding any secretary in criminal contempt of Congress is a serious and sober matter, one that I have done everything in my power to avoid. But in the case of the attorney general and the secretary, Secretary Ross, they blatantly obstructed our ability to do congressional oversight into the real reason Secretary Ross was trying for the first time in 70 years to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census."After weeks of back and forth, with the Department of Justice saying it was giving up the census fight only to have President Trump say he was considering an executive order to ensure the question was included, Trump announced last week he will instead have federal agencies turn over to the Commerce Department records on how many citizens and non-citizens are in the U.S. Catherine GarciaHouse kills Rep. Al Green's impeachment resolution after 332-95 voteThe House on Wednesday afternoon voted overwhelmingly to table a resolution proposed by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) on whether to immediately consider articles of impeachment against President Trump, effectively killing the measure.The final vote tally was 332-95 in favor of tabling. Every Republican voted to table, while Democrats were somewhat split with 95 showing support for considering impeachment, while 137 were opposed.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has long opposed immediately pursuing impeachment against Trump, fearing it will harm the Democrats' legislative agenda. Her camp seemingly held firm on Wednesday.Green's resolution was focused primarily on the president's recent racist tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen. It made no mention of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference, which has generally been the driver behind calls for impeachment in the past. Instead, Green said Trump had simply brought "contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute" upon the office of the presidency. Tim O'Donnell



    
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass an extension of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tried to win the Senate's consent to approve the House-passed bill, which would reauthorize funding until fiscal 2090. The bill cleared the House in a 402-12 vote last week.  But Paul objected, pointing to the country's growing debt and arguing that any new spending should be offset by cuts to other spending. "It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in the country," he said. "And therefore any new spending ...  should be offset by cutting spending that's less valuable. We need to, at the very least, have this debate." He added that if the House bill was brought up for a vote in the Senate he is planning to offer an amendment, "but until then I will object."  A spokesperson for Paul later told The Hill that Paul "is not blocking anything," adding that he is "simply seeking to pay for it." "As with any bill, Senator Paul always believes it needs to be paid for. Senator Paul is simply offering an amendment, which other senators support, to pay for this legislation," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Under Senate rules, any one senator can try to get consent, which requires the sign-off of the entire chamber, to pass a bill or resolution, but any one senator can also block that request.  Gillibrand, after Paul objected, said she was "deeply disappointed" in his decision, adding, "Enough of the political games."  "I am deeply disappointed that my colleague has just objected to the desperately needed and urgent bill for our 9/11 first responders," she added. Despite the back-and-forth on the floor, the Senate is expected to pass the bill before leaving for their summer recess by Aug. 2.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fast-tracked the House bill to the Senate calendar this week, paving the way for him to tee it up for a vote.  McConnell said after a meeting with 9/11 first responders that it was his plan to bring the bill up before the recess. "We want to try to deal with [the legislation] before the August recess," he said.--Updated at 3:23 p.m.Georgia senator hospitalized after fall Administration pushes back on quick budget deal: 'We have a way to go' Jon Stewart rips into Rand Paul after he blocks 9/11 victim compensation fund: 'An abomination' Schumer calls on FBI, FTC to investigate FaceAppSenate passes bill making hacking voting systems a federal crimeThe Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.


Seeing countless renewable energy records broken and milestones passed has been a constant source of encouraging news for our planet. Now, we have yet another impressive stat to celebrate: in the first half of 2019, Scotland generated enough energy from wind power to supply its homes twice over.Specifically, turbines generated 9.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity between January and June, enough to supply power to 4.47 million homes – not bad for a country that has around 2.6 million homes to its name.It's a record high for wind energy in Scotland, and it means the turbines could have provided enough electricity for every dwelling in Scotland, plus much of northern England as well, for the first six months of the year.March was the high watermark, with 2,194,981 MWh of output produced in the month."These are amazing figures, Scotland's wind energy revolution is clearly continuing to power ahead," says Robin Parker, the Climate & Energy Policy Manager at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). "Up and down the country, we are all benefiting from cleaner energy and so is the climate.""These figures show harnessing Scotland's plentiful onshore wind potential can provide clean green electricity for millions of homes across not only Scotland, but England as well."The UK as a whole is on a roll as far as renewable energy is concerned, because it just managed its longest stretch without relying on coal power since the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.Coal power stations didn't supply any energy to the grid for seven days in a row, according to the National Grid in the UK – a total of 167 consecutive hours. Gas turbines, nuclear power, solar energy and other renewables all played a part.That's in line with the UK government's target to do without coal completely by 2025, and it looks as though Scotland could have a big part to play in reaching that goal.Other countries are also benefiting from the increasing potential of renewables. Germany is another nation where renewable energy production has exceeded demand, thanks to heavy investment in wind and solar.Then there's the Qinghai Province in northwest China – home to some 5 million citizens – which has been running for weeks at a time on renewable energy, using sources including solar, wind and hydro power.This rapid improvement is down to both increased capacity and more efficient technology, as scientists figure out ways to generate more electricity from the same amount of sunshine or wind.Scotland is something of a pioneer when it comes to wind power, with onshore and offshore farms now at a capacity of 8,423 MW as of December 2018. The country is hoping to supply all of its energy from renewables within the next 12 months, a target it's on course to meet."These figures really highlight the consistency of wind energy in Scotland and why it now plays a major part in the UK energy market," says Alex Wilcox Brooke, Weather Energy Project Manager at Severn Wye Energy Agency.


AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicholas FandosWASHINGTON — The House voted Wednesday evening to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for their refusal to turn over key documents related to the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.The citations for two cabinet officials, approved 230 to 198, will breathe new life into a dispute that has touched all three branches of government over why Trump administration officials pushed to ask census respondents if they were American citizens and what that question’s effect would be.Democrats investigating the issue believe that the documents and testimony being shielded would confirm that the administration’s long-stated rationale for collecting the data — to better enforce the Voting Rights Act — was merely a cover for a politically motivated attempt to eliminate noncitizens from population statistics used to allocate political representation, diminishing Democratic power.The Supreme Court hinted at that theory last month in a ruling about the citizenship question, when it rejected the administration’s stated reason for adding it as “contrived.” And in an unusual twist, President Trump himself all but confirmed those suspicions this month when he said of the citizenship question, “You need it for Congress, for districting.” Last week, he announced his government would give up the effort in light of the court’s decision.Democrats said Wednesday that their investigation would continue regardless, in an effort to vindicate Congress’s oversight authority and potentially neuter future attempts to discourage participation by noncitizens in the census.“It is bigger than the census. It is about protecting the integrity of the Congress of the United States of America,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the Oversight and Reform Committee chairman, said as he whipped up support on the House floor. “We need to understand how and why the Trump administration tried to add a question based on pretext so that we can consider reforms to ensure that this never happens again.”The Commerce Department, the Justice Department and the White House all swiftly issued statements condemning the vote as a bad-faith smear that ignored administration officials efforts to cooperate. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, called the action a “ridiculous and yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.” She added, “their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds.”Wednesday’s contempt vote formally authorized the oversight panel to take Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross to federal court to seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas for the material in question. A lawsuit is expected in the coming weeks, and the administration has maintained it is on firm legal footing in its position.It also leveled a stinging personal rebuke to Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross by formally referring them to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. There is no real risk the department will pursue the case — Mr. Barr is the head of the Justice Department — but only once before has Congress held in contempt a sitting member of a presidential cabinet: Eric H. Holder Jr., President Barack Obama’s first attorney general.The Justice and Commerce Departments maintain that in this case they have sought to fully cooperate within legal bounds with the oversight committee’s requests. Democrats, they argue, are more interested in a political clash that can attract attention from the news media and embarrass the administration than they are in actual fact-finding and prematurely abandoned the negotiating table.Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross dispatched a last-minute letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Wednesday urging her to call off the vote. The materials the committee had demanded, they said, would require violation of legal privileges and executive privilege.“The key remaining issue is how the departments and the committee will address the material that is protected by privileges that have been repeatedly affirmed by the courts,” they wrote. “There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve.”Republicans have backed them up at each step, arguing Democrats are abusing oversight powers to contest a reasonable policy goal. But Democrats easily defeated their efforts to kill the contempt citations and replace them with a bill requiring the inclusion of a citizenship question by law.“Why are they doing this? Why are they doing this? All because they don’t want a simple question on the census,” said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top ranking Republican on the oversight panel. “This resolution is ridiculous, and we should vote it down.”It is not unusual for Congresses and White Houses of opposing parties to face off over oversight demands, haggling over documents and witnesses. But there is scant precedent for the volume and intensity of the disputes between this Democratic House and Mr. Trump, whose administration has taken a dim view of Congress’s authority to compel executive branch cooperation.The House Judiciary Committee, for instance, has been locked in a dispute with the Justice Department and White House over access to evidence underlying Robert S. Mueller III’s report on Russian election interference and access to key government officials who served as witnesses to the former special counsel. It may soon spawn additional contempt votes and court action.And an effort by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to obtain Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns has already been redirected to federal court after the Treasury Department refused to comply with requests and subpoenas.Wednesday would be the first time the House actually voted to hold a government official in contempt in one of the fights. The Judiciary Committee recommended that the House do so with Mr. Barr in the dispute over Mr. Mueller’s evidence. But the two sides struck a last-minute deal to avoid a formal contempt vote and the House merely voted to authorize court action to enforce the subpoena.The only other direct precedent for Tuesday’s vote was in 2012, when Republicans then in control of the House held Mr. Holder in contempt in connection with requests for information about the botched Fast and Furious gun trafficking investigation. Republicans ended up suing the Obama administration in the case and ultimately prevailed, but the case took years to wind its way thought the courts and could have gone on longer if the Obama administration had continued to appeal.The outcome in the census case could take just as long, potentially outlasting Mr. Trump’s term unless the two sides reach an agreement.The Democrats specifically say the two cabinet secretaries “obstructed and delayed” an oversight committee investigation that began in January. Mr. Ross provided sworn testimony to the committee in March 2018 in which he said he had decided to add the question “solely” based on a December 2017 request from the Justice Department asking for data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.But documents revealed in court and evidence collected by the committee in interviews and document requests indicated that the decision may have been more complicated. The possibility of adding a citizenship question, long a dream of Republicans active in redistricting fights, was pitched to the Trump campaign, the evidence showed, and was discussed by White House officials in early 2017. Mr. Ross himself sought to add a citizenship question before the Justice Department request and personally sought its assistance in September 2017.When Mr. Cummings issued subpoenas for documents related to departmental decision making, neither the Justice Department nor the Commerce Department fully complied, he said, producing records that were heavily blacked out or already public.The United States used to include a citizenship question on all census forms, but since 1950, it has appeared only on a longer, more detailed questionnaire sent at random to a small number of households and not on the forms that most residents receive.The debate over the citizenship question is not an academic one. Government experts have estimated that asking respondents their citizenship status would scare many immigrants from responding to the census, which counts all people living in the United States, not just citizens. It could ultimately result in an undercount of about 6.5 million people, they say.States rely on raw population data, rather than eligible voters, to draw House districts and to determine access to federal social welfare programs. Democrats were fearful that a significant undercount could reduce their representation and affect how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending were distributed.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Advertisement


When in a recent tweetstorm Donald Trump suggested that four Congresswomen of color leave the U.S. and “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” social media exploded. Outrage. Even some news outlets finally let go of the euphemisms and called the tweets “racist.” The Republicans, on the other hand, were quiet. As well they would be. The ideological demographics of the party dictated it.The GOP’s membership is nearly 90 percent white and can only envision carnage and extinction as it looks upon a rights-based, religious, racial and ideologically diverse America. Or, as Lindsey Graham had noted as early as 2012, “We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.”In short, the United States of America is not really their America. They yearn for a white republic. That’s why they are fighting to recreate the days when, as Archie Bunker sang, “Guys like us, we had it made.” That’s why they’ve willingly gone along with and participated in a sustained attack on the country itself, allowing it to grow weaker so that they could feel stronger.Already, Trump and the Republicans have severely harmed the institutional heft of checks-and-balances. But they’re not done. America’s international reputation and influence rest on enormous economic and military strength, as well as the intangible but all-important “soft power” brought on by a robust democracy. All three pillars are necessary to sustain America’s nearly global respect and position, yet — and this was the rub — all three are increasingly dependent on more than just whites in the United States to build and sustain. For white America to exist, America must die. And the Republicans have made their choice.In their effort to restore a white America, the GOP had to wound the kind of multiracial democracy that not only elected Barack Obama to the presidency but enhanced America’s global reputation. Republicans, therefore, set out to create an electorate that was disproportionately white and conservative. In Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Alabama, North Carolina and more than 20 additional states GOP policies targeted African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, the young and the poor to keep them away from the ballot box. Republican governors and GOP-majority state legislatures deployed an array of voter-suppression tactics, including closing hundreds of polling stations in minority and low-income precincts, slashing early voting hours, reinstating poll taxes, mandating discriminatory voter ID laws and purging millions from the voter rolls.Meanwhile, before his death, Republican legislative mapmaker Thomas Hofeller set in place another key foundation for a white republic. He crafted extreme gerrymandered Congressional districts across the United States that violated the basic Constitutional concept of “one person, one vote.” His legislative maps diluted the electoral strength of large, racially diverse cities, and magnified the power of overwhelmingly white suburbs and sparsely populated rural areas. In North Carolina, for example, Hofeller’s map meant that although Democrats won 50 percent of the vote in the 2018 election, they received only 23 percent of the Congressional seats. He also had devised a method to erase the electoral strength of the growing Hispanic population by rigging the Census in a way that would create legislative districts that, in his words, “would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,” and, by design, diminish the political voice of anyone else for at least a decade. (That effort was blocked by the Supreme Court.)The dismantling of a robust, multiracial democracy requires not only acts of commission, such as the 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder decision by the conservatives on the Supreme Court to gut the Voting Rights Act, but sins of omission as well. Mitch McConnell’s flat-out refusal to even engage legislation that would protect the nation’s electoral infrastructure from hacking and foreign interference, despite solid evidence that it occurred in 2016, sends a clear signal that for his ilk this is not an American democracy worth protecting or saving.The dangerous quest for a white republic is also undermining the U.S. military. When Trump came to power, there were more than 40,000 immigrants in uniform willing to fight and die for the United States. About 5,000 joined every year. The Department of Defense under this Administration, however, has either proposed or implemented policies that renege on promises of citizenship for immigrants in the armed services, issued directives that ban immigrants, even those with special language and medical skills, from serving and threatened to deport the families of those who are currently in the armed forces. Meanwhile, soldiers and sailors who are supposed to represent and defend all Americans have been seen proudly wearing MAGA caps and patches, even though racial and ethnic minorities “made up 40% of Defense Department active-duty military in 2015.” Not surprisingly, in 2018, the Army missed its recruiting goals and then had to lower its expectations for 2019, to avoid two consecutive years of failure.The economic might of the United States has not been spared either. While much of the discussion on the economy and immigration has focused on the impact on the agricultural sector, the GOP’s xenophobic policies are also taking a direct hit on higher education and the nation’s capacity for and leadership in technological and scientific innovation. A 2013 report notes that international students enrolled in American universities accounted for “70.3 percent of all full-time graduate students in electrical engineering, 63.2 percent in computer science, 60.4 percent in industrial engineering, and more than 50 percent in chemical, materials and mechanical engineering, as well as in economics (a non-STEM field).” Those students bring the brainpower to innovation, research and technology. In fact, between May 2009 and May 2015, employment in STEM occupations grew by 10.5 percent, compared with 5.2 percent in non-STEM occupations. Nearly three-fourths of those employed in Silicon Valley tech companies are not American citizens. Yet, with the rise of Trump and his policies and rhetoric, U.S. higher education, which fuels this STEM growth, is simply not as attractive as it had been. After Trump came to office and launched the Muslim Ban, harangues to “Build the Wall” and disparaging comments about “shithole countries,” enrollment from international students dropped 5.5 percent in graduate programs and more than 6 percent in undergraduate programs at American universities.The determination to build MAGA Land explains why what should be obvious tripwires – disrespecting military heroes; engaging in widespread corruption; cavorting with a communist dictator in North Korea and a journalist-killing authoritarian in Saudi Arabia; dodging multiple allegations of sexual assault, including rape; creating horrific scenes of White House-sponsored cruelty on the border; and believing Putin over our own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election – have all failed to dislodge one of the most unpopular presidents in recorded history. Put simply, because Trump promises Republicans a return to white dominance, he is more important to the GOP and its base than the country those in power took an oath to support and defend.Trump’s vicious tweets have once again spurred a conversation about whether the President is racist, and the Republicans’ relative silence has once again raised questions about why they refuse to condemn him (only four GOP members voted for a House resolution to do so). But to focus solely on this week’s events, or even to look at Trump’s many racist statements in the past, is to miss the bigger picture: The scurrilous attack on Representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib was just part and parcel of a larger assault on America and the rich diversity and rights culture that are essential for true greatness.Contact us at editors@time.com.

					Philip Rodriguez was fired from his post as Brighton City Manager in a 5-4 vote late Tuesday night by a city council who had “lost faith” in him and who had questioned his ability to lead, despite the former city manager blowing the whistle on the city accumulating $70 million in water overcharges and calling for a forensic audit into those irregularities.In a news conference following his ouster, Rodriguez said his discovery of utility fund corruption in the city “has officially turned into a council cover-up tonight.”“When I, as a city manager, persisted with the council calling for a forensic audit, and as an individual citizen notifying state and federal law enforcement, the council chose to fire me for blowing the whistle,” he said in a prepared statement. “And yet I was told tonight, and it was on record that there was no cause for my termination.”The former city manager told news media that ever since discovering unnecessarily high rates based “on falsehood and illegal budgeting practices,” the council had worked on thwarting his efforts in order to get to the bottom of what he called “mysteries in utilities.”Further, Rodriguez claimed the $70 million in water overcharges wasn’t the only issue he uncovered as city manager.Read the full story from our partner at thedenverchannel.com. 


The former ‘Daily Show’ host told Fox News that Paul was trying to “balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.”Senior WriterOne month ago, former Daily Show host Jon Stewart went on Fox News to shame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to protect 9/11 first responders. Wednesday afternoon, he was back on that network to give his fellow Republican senator from Kentucky a piece of his mind. In an interview with Bret Baier, Stewart immediately took aim at Rand Paul who, along with Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), blocked a Senate bill that would extend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, making the case that it should be offset by other spending cuts.  Responding directly to Paul, Stewart called his objection “absolutely outrageous,” adding, “Pardon me if I’m not impressed in any way by Rand Paul’s fiscal responsibility virtue signaling.” Stewart went on to condemn Paul for supporting President Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut that “added hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit” and now trying to “balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.” “Bret, this is about what kind of society we have,” a clearly furious Stewart continued. “At some point, we have to stand up for the people who have always stood up for us, and at this moment in time maybe cannot stand up for themselves due to their illnesses and their injuries. And what Rand Paul did today on the floor of the Senate was outrageous.” “He is a guy who put us in hundreds of billions of dollars in debt,” he said of Paul. “And now he’s going to tell us that a billion dollars a year over 10 years is just too much for us to handle? You know, there are some things that they have no trouble putting on the credit card, but somehow when it comes to the 9/11 first responder community—the cops, the firefighters, the construction workers, the volunteers, the survivors—all of a sudden we’ve got to go through this.” Appearing next to Stewart was 9/11 first responder and activist John Feal, who thanked the host and Fox News as a whole for being so “generous” with their time on this issue before calling Senators Paul and Lee “bottom-feeders” who “lack humanity” and “lack leadership.”Stewart said survivors like Feal and others shouldn’t have to “drag themselves back to Washington, put their hats in their hands and beg for something that this country should have done 14 years ago,” adding, “It’s an abomination.”

Is there any expression of racism that Republicans will actually admit is racism? It's a question on a lot of progressive minds in the wake of Donald Trump demonizing female congresswomen of color with the "go back" canard that white nationalists and other assorted racists have long used to abuse anyone with heritage they dislike, whether that heritage is Jewish, Irish, Italian, African, Latin American or Muslim. Telling someone to "go back" is, in the ranks of racist statements, right up there with calling a person the N-word or some other rank slur. Yet, there still appears to be resistance among Republicans to admitting that is racism, which leads many on the left to wonder: If this doesn't count, then what could possibly count?The answer, it's becoming quite clear, is that there is no limit. There's no line in the sand, no sentiment so ugly, where most Republicans will cave in and admit, OK, that's racist.A new poll from Ipsos confirms this. While more than two-thirds of Americans correctly identify the "go back" language as racist, only 45% of Republicans agree with that assessment. Instead, 57% of Republicans agreed that these women should "leave" the country where all four are citizens, and where three of the four were born. A startlingly large majority of Republicans — 70% — also said that the word "racist" is a bad-faith effort to discredit a political opponent's views.On Tuesday, the Democrats introduced a House resolution to condemn Trump for his remarks. All hell broke loose when Speaker Nancy Pelosi identified Trump's remarks as "racist." Republican House members exploded in outrage, claiming that the word "racist" is a personal insult against Trump, instead of a fair and accurate assessment of what he said (and has insisted on repeating). In the end, only four Republican members voted for the resolution condemning Trump's racist remarks — and three of them are in swing districts where they barely won in 2018. All other Republicans in the House voted no, standing on the claim that "racist" was a mischaracterization of the president's words. Why are Republicans so resistant to admitting that Trump is a racist and that his words and deeds are frequently racist? Like many debates, this one gets caught up in semantics. The word "racist" necessarily implies beliefs that are inherently irrational and unfair. To be blunt about it, most conservatives do not agree that certain sentiments —  such as insinuating that people of color have less right to call themselves "American" or that people of color owe white people subservience and gratitude — are either irrational or unfair.On the contrary, what has become clear in recent years is that most conservatives feel like they are hard-headed realists who are being suppressed or attacked by sanctimonious liberals when they try to speak their truth. Trump, with his willingness to air out his beliefs about the superiority of white people, is viewed as a leader in their movement to shake off the shackles of political correctness.("In your heart, you know he's right," reads a popular Trump meme shared by conservatives on Facebook.)As Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times writes, Trump believes that if "you are white, then regardless of origin, you have a legitimate claim to American citizenship," whereas if  "you are not, then you don’t."For liberals, this belief is irrational and cruel. Trump supporters, on the other hand, see it as rational and just. So they bristle at the word "racist", which carries an obvious level of negative judgment. To admit that these beliefs are racist is to admit that they are bad beliefs, and conservatives aren't willing to do that. Even outright white supremacists often reject the "racist" label, instead calling themselves silly things like "race realists."This disconnect is at the heart of nearly every debate over racism in this country. Take, for instance, the ugly fight over the writer Sam Harris' embrace of Charles Murray, a right-wing political scientist who has spent much of his career peddling the idea that black people's lower average IQ scores are the result of inherent inferiority instead of a reflection of racial oppression. Harris and Murray argued that this belief was "forbidden knowledge," implicitly comparing themselves to suppressed or persecuted scientific revolutionaries like Galileo. The goal, of course, is to present themselves as objective advocates for truth instead of bigots who distort the evidence to serve racist ends. (Which is pretty clearly what they are.)On Tuesday, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, clearly thinking he had a great "gotcha" question, asked Republican senatorial candidate and vote-suppression advocate Kris Kobach if he would still vote for Trump if Trump said, "I am a racist."Kobach refused to give a straight answer, giving Cuomo the viral clip he desired. But the question itself was inherently misleading. Almost nobody in contemporary America will self-identify as "racist." Kobach, for instance, is as racist a politician as they come, but he rejects the label. Everyone superficially agrees that "racist" is a bad thing to be — because it signifies irrational prejudice — and Kobach does not think that he or Trump is being irrational when they hint strongly that white people are more deserving of the designation "American" than other people.This is why the public debate over the border crisis is so fraught. The issue isn't really over the facts of the matter, which are that Trump and his administration are targeting asylum seekers with inhumane treatment because almost all asylum seekers (at this historical moment) belong to ethnic groups Trump dislikes. The issue is over whether it's a bad thing to target people on the basis of race or ethnicity.Sure, Trump and his allies bristle and deny that they are specifically targeting Latino immigrants. But that act is deliberately half-hearted and insincere. A more holistic look at Trump's communications to the conservative base makes clear that the actual message being sent is a lot closer to: "Hell yeah, we are targeting brown-skinned people, and we love it."As Heather Digby Parton pointed out in Salon, the whole purpose of Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Lindsey Graham's recent visit to a migrant detention center in McAllen, Texas, was "to reassure their voters that they were treating the scary brown people with much cruelty as they could get away with" by making sure people knew that these men were being crammed into cages, denied sleep and showers, and basically subjected to torture.You would be hard-pressed to find a conservative who would characterize his own satisfaction at seeing this abuse as "racism." "Racism" by definition is irrational and unfair, and Trump's supporters think their stereotypes about Latino immigrants being criminals are justified.Racism is hard to eradicate because the racist brain has a robust immune system developed to protect its bigoted beliefs. Efforts to educate about the irrationality of racist beliefs are dismissed as "political correctness." Efforts to stigmatize the expression of racist views are characterized as assaults on "free speech." Unfortunately, that also means that these kinds of public debates about race only make Trump supporters more fiercely defensive of their bigoted beliefs, which the Ipsos polll registered by showing that Republican support for Trump has intensified in the wake of his "go back" comments.Trump's opponents need to understand what they're up against. This is not a matter of a bunch of confused or stupid people who are bamboozled by Trump and can be gently educated into being better people. (Of course there are a few conservatives at the margins who feel qualms about Trump, and they can be appealed to.) For the most part, these are hardened bigots who love what Trump is doing and cannot be shamed or browbeaten out of it. The only realistic option is for the left to out-organize the right and make sure that the majority of Americans, who reject Trump's agenda, show up to the polls to stop him.

Jeffrey Epstein used a foreign passport with a fake name to enter several countries in the 1980s including the United Kingdom, Spain and Saudi Arabia, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.The questionable travel document was found inside a safe — along with $70,000 in cash and 48 loose diamonds — in the New York City home of the wealthy financier and accused sex trafficker. It contained a photo of Epstein with a different name and listed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia, according to prosecutors.Epstein's lawyers filed court papers Tuesday claiming he obtained the Austrian passport in 1982 for "personal protection" to be presented to "potential kidnappers, hijackers, or terrorists." The lawyers said Epstein's Jewish faith and substantial wealth made him a target while traveling in the Middle East.Epstein's attorneys also said that the government provided no evidence that he ever used the passport.But Wednesday, prosecutors did just that."In fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s," the court papers say.Prosecutors added that Epstein's lawyers have yet to explain some of the basic questions concerning the passport, including how he obtained it and whether he's a citizen of another country.Epstein's lawyers did not immediately return a request for comment.The travel document has become a key component of the government's argument for keeping Epstein locked up on charges alleging he sexually abused dozens of underage girls in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005.Prosecutors say it demonstrates Epstein's ability to obtain false travel documents and underscores his "serious risk of flight." They also point to his extraordinary wealth, access to private planes and limited family ties.Defense lawyers have asked the judge to allow Epstein to remain at his $77 million Manhattan mansion with electronic monitoring as the case plays out.A judge is expected to issue a ruling on the bail request Thursday.Epstein, who is being held at a federal prison in New York City, faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.Tom Winter is a New York-based correspondent covering crime, courts, terrorism, and financial fraud on the East Coast for the NBC News Investigative Unit.Rich Schapiro is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

It doesn’t mean we look the other way and let the president ride roughshod over Congress,” he continued. “So even if this administration will not stand up for the values, the Congress should. And the Congress will.”Earlier this year, Congress approved a resolution to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war.Trump used the second veto of his presidency to quash the Yemen resolution. The Senate, where the resolution originated, did not muster the 67 votes needed to override the veto.Congress has been furious at Saudi Arabia over its killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.Khashoggi’s death compounded existing anger at Saudi Arabia over the Yemen civil war’s civilian deaths, the majority of which have been blamed on Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.Despite Congress already having registered its displeasure with the Yemen war powers vote in May, Secretary of State Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoPompeo changes staff for Russia meeting after concerns raised about top negotiator's ties: report Ben Carson: Trump is not a racist and his comments were not racist US bans top Myanmar generals from country over attacks on Rohingya Muslims  MORE invoked an emergency provision of the law governing arms sales to approve 22 deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without the typical 30-day congressional review period.The move infuriated lawmakers, who accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass Congress. Lawmakers had been blocking the sales from moving forward because of concerns about the civilian casualties in Yemen.The administration and its allies have argued the arms sales are necessary because of what they described as heightened threats from Iran.“Right now, as I speak, Iran is stretching its tentacles of terror across the Middle East,” Foreign Affairs ranking member Rep.

Prosecutors in Nantucket on Wednesday dropped a felony sexual assault charge against the actor Kevin Spacey, after watching their case against the actor slowly fall apart under scrutiny from Spacey's defense team during months of contentious pre-trial hearings that unfolded in the resort island's lone courtroom.

The decision to drop the charges followed a meeting between the accuser, his parents and prosecutors on Sunday, July 14, following a July 8 hearing in which the alleged victim exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a hearing in which he was testifying about his missing cell phone.

"The complaining witness was informed that if he chose to continue to invoke his Fifth Amendment right, the case would not be able to go forward," Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said in a statement released on Wednesday. "After a further period of reflection privately with his lawyer, the complaining witness elected not to waive his right under the Fifth Amendment."

But the criminal case against Spacey appeared to be plagued nearly from the start by one stunning revelation after another about missteps by the case investigators, the prosecutors and the alleged victim's relatives and civil attorney.
In October, 2017, the young man contacted the Cape and Islands District Attorney's office to allege that 15 months earlier Spacey had plied him with beer and whiskey in July 2016 after the two met at the Club Car bar and restaurant in Nantucket, where the young man had worked that summer as a busboy, and sexually assaulted him.
The alleged victim admitted to authorities from the start that he lied to Spacey about his age, saying he was a 23-year-old college student attending Wake Forest University, when in fact he was an 18-year-old busboy working at the restaurant where he met the actor and sought an autograph for his girlfriend.

The alleged victim told investigators that while Spacey was touching him, he was texting and communicating with his girlfriend and other friends on Snapchat and sent his girlfriend a Snapchat video of Spacey groping him, according to the criminal complaint.

He alleged the inappropriate touching of his genitals continued for about three minutes, according to the complaint. Those texts and videos have been a key focus of heated, pre-trial courtroom debates during previous hearings in the case.

In January, authorities charged Spacey with a single felony count of indecent assault and battery.

But over the course of months of pre-trial hearings, it emerged that the mother of Spacey's accuser had deleted potentially exculpatory data from her son's cell phone before turning it over to police, and that the lead investigator in the case did not file a report stating the mother's voluntary admission until just last month -- in June, 2019 -- more than three years after the alleged encounter.

When Spacey's defense team learned of these developments last month, they sought from the judge in the case and were granted direct access to the accuser's phone.

Defense attorneys, who compared the results of the state's forensic examination of the phone with screenshots of the group chat conversation from that night that the accuser had texted to investigators, concluded that key parts of those conversations had been deleted before the phone was turned over to investigators.

A civil attorney for the accuser then informed the court that the phone had apparently been irretrievably lost -- and even questioned whether police returned the device to the family at all after the government completed its forensic exam of the device's contents.
The accuser appeared in court earlier this month and took the witness stand on orders from the judge to explain what happened to the phone. He testified he did not report the alleged assault to police for 15 months, in October, 2017, rather than the three months prosecutors had been contending since filing charges against the actor in January. The lead investigator in the case testified later that day under questioning from Spacey's defense attorney that the one-year difference was the result of a "typo," and a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office acknowledged the error, for the first time, in response to queries from ABC News.

He also testified that he had turned the phone back over to the accuser's family a few weeks after obtaining it. But the accuser's father went on to testify that he doesn't recall ever receiving the device back, prompting the lead investigator to acknowledge that he was "remiss" and failed to get a signed receipt confirming the return of the phone.
But part of the way through the accuser's July 8 testimony, during questioning from Spacey defense attorney Alan Jackson, a recess was called after the accuser was asked whether he was aware that it's a crime to delete potentially exculpatory data from a piece of evidence in a criminal probe. He said on the stand that he had not been aware of that.
During the recess, the accuser informed the judge through a representative that he had decided to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to protect himself against self-incrimination -- and declined further testimony. That prompted Barrett to order the accuser's testimony stricken from the record.
That led Jackson to demand of Nantucket District Court Judge Thomas Barrett that the case be dismissed on the spot. An assistant district attorney asked for a week to confer with his office.

"This entire case is completely compromised" by the accuser's decision to take the Fifth, Jackson told Barrett. "He's the sole witness than can establish the circumstances of his allegation."

Barrett declined to immediately dismiss the charge, but acknowledged from the bench that "without [the accuser's testimony], the Commonwealth will have a tough row to hoe," adding that it remained unclear whether the case would "continue or collapse" without the testimony of the accuser himself.

Then last month, in the middle of the criminal proceedings, the accuser filed a civil lawsuit against Spacey, a move that confounded legal experts who spoke to ABC News and further jeopardizing the criminal case. The civil lawsuit was withdrawn weeks later.

In Oct. 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed in a BuzzFeed interview that Spacey made sexual advances towards him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 and Spacey was 26.

When the story was made public, Spacey posted a statement on Twitter saying he is "beyond horrified" by the story, but doesn't remember the encounter. He went on to say he was examining himself and now chooses "to [openly] live as a gay man."

Rapp's allegation prompted a flood of similar allegations against the actor for groping and other inappropriate behavior over the course of his long career, but to date no other charges beside the now-dropped Nantucket charge have been filed against him.

The accuser's mother, Heather Unruh, is a former longtime New England television anchor at ABC News affiliate WCVB in Boston.

The young man's civil attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, issued a brief statement following the announcement of the dropping of the criminal charge.

"My client and his family have shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances," Garabedian said in the statement. "I have no further comment at this time."

												President Trump on Wednesday repeated the claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar committed immigration fraud by illegally marrying her brother.Trump made the statement while responding to a question from a reporter from the One America News Network before leaving for a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.Reporter Emerald Robinson asked the president “if the administration was looking into possible immigration fraud committed by Ilhan Omar for possibly marrying her brother.”“Well, there’s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it,” Trump said.“I hear she was married to her brother. You’re asking me a question about it. I don’t know, but I’m sure there’s somebody who will be looking at that,” he added.Trump’s statement comes amid his ongoing feud with a group of freshman congresswomen known as “the Squad,” which includes Omar. Last weekend, Trump wrote on Twitter that the congresswomen should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how​ it is done​.”Trump’s tweet prompted House Democrats to adopt a resolution condemning the statement as “racist.”The claim that Omar illegally wed her brother so he could gain American citizenship first surfaced on conservative blogs in 2016, when she was running for the Minnesota state legislature.In a statement that year, Omar called it “baseless rumors” that “are absolutely false and ridiculous.”Omar then said she had married her current partner, Ahmed Hirsi, in the eyes of her Muslim faith in 2002 — but never legally married him. Their partnership ended in 2008.Omar then legally married Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009, but that union ended in 2011, according to her statement.“Insinuations that Ahmed Nur Said Elmi is my brother are absurd and offensive,” she said at the time.The same year Elmi and Omar split, she reconciled with her first husband, and the pair are still together.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922July 18, 2019 (Mainichi Japan)Japanese version
    KYOTO -- An explosion at an animation studio here on the morning of July 18 has left one person dead and 12 others are in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, police and firefighters said.

    A man allegedly entered the Kyoto Animation building in Fushimi Ward in the western Japan city of Kyoto at around 10:30 a.m., poured what appeared to be gasoline around and set fire to it. The man was injured and admitted to a hospital.

    The suspect who is in his 40s told prefectural police that he set fire to the building. Police are treating the case as arson.

    The blast occurred at the No. 1 studio of Kyoto Animation. At least 36 people were said to be injured.

    About 30 fire engines were mobilized to extinguish the fire.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass an extension of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tried to win the Senate's consent to approve the House-passed bill, which would reauthorize funding until fiscal 2090. The bill cleared the House in a 402-12 vote last week.  But Paul objected, pointing to the country's growing debt and arguing that any new spending should be offset by cuts to other spending. "It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in the country," he said. "And therefore any new spending ...  should be offset by cutting spending that's less valuable. We need to, at the very least, have this debate." He added that if the House bill was brought up for a vote in the Senate he is planning to offer an amendment, "but until then I will object."  A spokesperson for Paul later told The Hill that Paul "is not blocking anything," adding that he is "simply seeking to pay for it." "As with any bill, Senator Paul always believes it needs to be paid for. Senator Paul is simply offering an amendment, which other senators support, to pay for this legislation," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Under Senate rules, any one senator can try to get consent, which requires the sign-off of the entire chamber, to pass a bill or resolution, but any one senator can also block that request.  Gillibrand, after Paul objected, said she was "deeply disappointed" in his decision, adding, "Enough of the political games."  "I am deeply disappointed that my colleague has just objected to the desperately needed and urgent bill for our 9/11 first responders," she added. Despite the back-and-forth on the floor, the Senate is expected to pass the bill before leaving for their summer recess by Aug. 2.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fast-tracked the House bill to the Senate calendar this week, paving the way for him to tee it up for a vote.  McConnell said after a meeting with 9/11 first responders that it was his plan to bring the bill up before the recess. "We want to try to deal with [the legislation] before the August recess," he said.--Updated at 3:23 p.m.Georgia senator hospitalized after fall Administration pushes back on quick budget deal: 'We have a way to go' Jon Stewart rips into Rand Paul after he blocks 9/11 victim compensation fund: 'An abomination' Schumer calls on FBI, FTC to investigate FaceAppSenate passes bill making hacking voting systems a federal crimeThe Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the Democratic congresswomen of color he told to “go back” to where “they came” from.“Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds,” the president said.The MAGA crowd knew just what to do next.“Send her back! Send her back! Send her back,” the audience chanted as Trump soaked it in for a few moments.Omar is a United States citizen.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Following widespread outrage over the bigoted tweetstorm, the president has continued to double-down on his remarks and has repeatedly called out Omar by name, falsely accusing her of supporting Al Qaeda and hating Jewish people.As Republicans have largely stood by the president as he ramps up his racist attacks, the House of Representatives voted to condemn Trump over his comments. While the vote was largely down party lines, four Republicans and one independent (Justin Amash, who recently left the GOP) joined the Democrats in passing the resolution.

Free movies on YouTubeJeffrey Epstein’s pilot deletes Instagram after Kellyanne Conway pic surfaces

captbigsky/Instagram

He was pictured with Trump’s longest-serving White House aide. The news cycles in the Trump era move so quickly that a story can be the only thing anyone is talking about one day, and totally forgotten the next. But the arrest of financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has managed to stick around since it first broke on July 6. Part of this can be attributed to the powerful people in Epstein’s orbit, and part of it to the sheer luridness of the charges against him, sexual trafficking young girls to his various properties, even after getting an apparent sweetheart deal… from a U.S. attorney later appointed to Trump’s cabinet. It’s a lot.In fact, it’s so much that a universe of conspiracy theories and hoaxes quickly emerged. Some pulled in accusations from the QAnon and Pizzagate spheres, including QAnon posts about supposed tunnels under Epstein’s properties and Satanic rituals involving sex and human sacrifice. QAnon is the ongoing conspiracy that maintains a secret group of deep state officials is working to undermine President Donald Trump. Others were the reflexive defenses of Trump supporters trying to put daylight between the president and Epstein. As the case has moved forward, more rumors and hoaxes have emerged, with many getting enormous attention in spite of being either speculation or already proven untrue.Here are more of the biggest Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories and hoaxes:  A few days after Epstein’s arrest, an Instagram picture emerged that appeared to show Epstein pilot Larry Visoski posing with senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway on Dec. 28, 2016, in Palm Beach—long after the last time Trump claims he spoke with Epstein. Visoski, going by the screen name “CaptBigDawg,” appears to be smiling as he posed with Conway, whom he called a “very Humble and gracious Lady [sic].” A day afer it started making the rounds, both it and Visoski’s Instagram page have been deleted. But Visoski definitely is (or was) Epstein’s personal pilot, and Conway was in Palm Beach at the time. Ohai, It's Larry Visoski, Jeffrey Epstein's chief pilot, hanging out with @KellyannePolls just before NYE 2016.Weird, huh?https://t.co/mY7JmGqZPU pic.twitter.com/D04xP9o9IZWhile the picture is almost certainly real, there’s no indication of anything sinister behind it, or any particular significance to it at all. It might be true that a senior Trump adviser met with the pilot of a convicted sex offender, but that doesn’t mean either Conway or Trump ever met with Epstein around the time it was taken. She might not have even known he had a connection to Epstein. It’s simply a picture of two people, not evidence of a sinister conspiracy or horrible crime. For the record, Trump was in Florida at the time—the 28th was the day of his bizarre press conference with Don King at Mar-A-Lago.With Epstein being held in the federally operated Manhattan Correctional Center, the massive blackout that hit Manhattan on July 13 was seen by QAnon believers as just a bit too convenient. Very quickly, conspiracy theories started flying that the blackout was pulled off by the deep state via either sabotage or an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) as a way of getting Epstein out of prison before he could start naming names.These blackouts in major cities are likely white hat EMP attacks to disable the security measures of hidden enemy facilities as part of ongoing raids by federal law enforcement in the wake of Epstein's arrest. We have never seen anything like this. #TheStormIsHereTo be clear, there is no evidence that the deep state used an EMP to shut down a fairly small part of the electricity in Manhattan. An actual EMP going off would devastate the entire city, and shut down every form of electronics—including the ubiquitous cell phones used to record the blackout’s aftermath. But the biggest element that falsifies this conspiracy is that the Manhattan Correctional Center is substantially far from the actual area that was blacked out—it’s in Lower Manhattan, while the blackout was localized to the west and south of Central Park, over six miles from the prison.Epstein remains in prison and was at a bail hearing after the blackout. So if it was meant to cover his escape, it was a miserable failure.Could the president’s racist tweets, directed this time at four outspoken first-term members of the House known as “the Squad,” be a clever ruse to shift media attention away from his former friend, and in particular, the lurid contents of Epstein’s safe? Trump’s Twitter feed gets outsized attention no matter what, and his exhortations that Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) should “go back to…the crime infested places from which they came” have suddenly become the biggest story going—a perch occupied last week by Epstein’s arrest.Since Epstein's safe was raided, Trump has gone full White Supremacist....coincidence? #RacistPresidentIt’s not in evidence either way, and it’s entirely possible Trump is doing this to divert attention away from Epstein’s crimes and his potential links to them. But it’s also not like this is something new for Trump, who began his campaign in 2015 with a speech declaring Mexico is “sending” rapists and drug dealers across the southern border. Maybe Epstein really did have diamonds and a fake Saudi passport in his safe, but Trump unleashes Twitter tirades at far more insignificant provocations. Finally, Epstein’s case will drag on for months and years—when it’s likely that Trump’s feud with “the Squad” will burn out far sooner. So if it’s meant to be a distraction, it’s not going to distract anyone for long.Some QAnon believers have moved on from the attempted breakout that never happened to claim that Epstein will be the first of the long-foretold military tribunals that will mark the beginning of Q’s purge, “the Storm.” Why? Because, as this anon claims, Epstein was arrested on his private airplane, and never touched U.S. soil—thereby making him subject to military law, not U.S. law. The trial of pedophiles and Democrats via military judgment, rather than civil courts, is a major part of the QAnon mythology, and if this turns out to be true it would go a long way toward proving the efficacy of Q’s claims.#Qanon #WWG1WGA #hereComesThePAIN#firstMilitaryTribunal??!!! pic.twitter.com/VcZ7bIE0k7It’s not clear from the reporting whether Epstein was actually arrested on his plane, or after having disembarked at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. It also doesn’t matter. An airport is not subject to either international or military law, while  U.S. law is clear that civilian courts will try civilians as long as they’re functioning. Military tribunals for non-combatants are illegal, and there’s no evidence that any contact Epstein is having with the justice system is taking place outside of normal American jurisprudence.  Assuming Epstein’s situation drags on without him pleading guilty, expect to become more lurid, and more conspiracy theories and hoaxes to emerge on both sides of the political aisle. Some will be nonsensical, and others will require a little more critical thinking to debunk. As always, be skeptical of anything you read about Epstein. READ MORE:Got five minutes?

AdvertisementSupported byBy Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Nick CorasanitiThe Supreme Court of New Jersey, responding to a nationwide backlash over insensitive comments made by several judges in sexual assault cases, announced new mandatory training on Wednesday for judges across the entire system.The move came as one judge involved in one of the high-profile cases resigned and removal proceedings were initiated for another. James Troiano, the Monmouth County judge who recommended leniency for a 16-year-old boy accused of rape because the boy was from a “good family,” resigned from the bench, officials said.The comments by Judge Troiano, which were made in a 2018 ruling, were seen by advocates for sexual assault victims as emblematic of a legal system that is mired in bias and privilege, and has deterred victims from reporting assaults.Shortly after the comments became public in early July, elected officials called for the judge’s resignation, petitions circulated for his disbarment and a protest was held outside the Monmouth County courthouse where the judge had made the ruling. Judge Troiano and his family even received threats of violence.The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Judge Troiano, who had retired in late 2012, but continued to hear cases on a part-time basis, requested to step down. The court acceded and terminated his services effective immediately. A spokeswoman for the court said Mr. Troiano will keep his pension, which according to the state Treasury is calculated at 75 percent of his salary, for a total of $123,750.Also on Wednesday, the state Supreme Court ordered a new initiative to improve the training of judges in the areas of sexual assault, domestic violence, implicit bias and diversity.“The programs also will train judges in effective communication skills that will aid them in delivering clear decisions that are rooted in the law, respectful of victims, and understandable to the public while protecting the rights of the accused,” Glenn A. Grant, the acting administrative director of the courts, said in a statement.Under the new initiative, the courts will recess within the next 90 days for a mandatory full-day educational conference focused partly on sexual assault. Mandatory annual training sessions will be developed with subject matter experts to train judges and judiciary staff.The Supreme Court also announced that it would begin removal proceedings for Judge John F. Russo, who asked a woman if she had closed her legs to try to prevent an alleged sexual assault.“Because of the seriousness of the ethical violations here, it is appropriate for the Court to consider the full range of potential discipline, up to and including removal from office,” wrote Justice Stuart Rabner, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.In the order, Justice Rabner cited a report from the Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct that found Mr. Russo showed “an absolute disregard for the solemnity that must attend every court proceeding, particularly those involving such serious concerns as domestic violence.”The removal process for a judge in New Jersey involves a formal hearing before a panel of Supreme Court judges. The order also suspends Judge Russo without pay pending the outcome of removal proceedings.Lawyers for Mr. Russo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The controversy sparked by the two judges drew widespread condemnation from elected officials in New Jersey, many of whom called for the removal of both judges. On Wednesday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy released a statement praising the Supreme Court’s actions. “Unfortunately, the inexcusable actions of several judges over recent months have threatened this reputation for thoughtful and reasoned opinion, and common decency,” Mr. Murphy said. “I am gratified that Judge Troiano will no longer sit on the bench and that removal proceedings will begin against Judge Russo.”Judge Troiano, a longtime family court judge, made the comments in 2018 when deciding whether to try the accused teenager as an adult. Prosecutors had said the teenager sexually assaulted a visibly intoxicated 16-year-old girl at a party and recorded the act, sending the video to his friends, along with a text that said, “When your first time is rape.”Judge Troiano decided the boy should not be tried as an adult, but an appeals court sharply rebuked and overturned his decision in June.The appeals court warned Judge Troiano, 69, against showing bias toward affluent teenagers and said “the judge decided the case for himself.” Family court cases are typically confidential, but some of Judge Troiano’s comments became public in the appeals court’s 14-page ruling.In making his decision last year, Judge Troiano appeared to question the girl’s level of intoxication, cited the boy’s good grades and college prospects and drew distinctions between sexual assault and the “traditional case of rape” at gunpoint.In a two-hour decision, Judge Troiano questioned aloud whether prosecutors had adequately explained to the girl and her family that pressing charges would destroy the boy’s life.“He is clearly a candidate for not just college but probably for a good college,” the judge said.He added: “This young man comes from a good family who put him into an excellent school where he was doing extremely well. His scores for college entry were very high.”Judge Troiano retired in December 2012, but continued to work three days a week as a “recall” judge, occasionally filling in to help ease a backlog of court cases. There are currently 63 judges on recall in state Superior Court. Judge Troiano declined to comment through a family member.Last month, the appeals court also scolded a Middlesex County family court judge, Marcia Silva, who said during the sexual assault case of a 12-year-old girl that “beyond losing her virginity, the state did not claim that the victim suffered any further injuries, either physical, mental or emotional.”Officials have not taken any action against Judge Silva despite similar calls for her resignation.“The comments were victim-blaming and a manifestation of the fears that many survivors have when deciding how they want to proceed in the aftermath of an assault,” the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement last week referring to the cases before Judge Troiano and Judge Silva.Last week, the state’s top public defender came to the defense of Judges Troiano and Silva, issuing a rare public statement expressing concern on the impact the criticism of the judges could have on the judicial process.“Vilifying or seeking the removal of judges who make unpopular or even erroneous decisions threatens the independence of the judiciary,” said Joseph Krakora, the top public defender for New Jersey. “Judges are simply lawyers entrusted with the responsibility of deciding difficult cases. Litigants sometimes feel that their decisions are incorrect or unfair. That is why we have appellate courts.”Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 230 are reported to the police, 9 are referred to prosecutors and 5 will lead to a felony conviction, according to Department of Justice data analyzed by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.Local advocates had for years clamored for judges to be trained in how to treat sexual assault victims, and legislation had recently been introduced. Without naming judges by name, Mr. Grant, the active administrative director, said the trainings stem from “particular events” that “prompt us to engage in critical self-analysis that suggests the need to do more to instill the Judiciary’s longstanding guiding policies and principles into our daily practices.”Luis Ferré-Sadurní writes about housing in New York City for the Metro Desk.

AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicholas FandosWASHINGTON — The House voted Wednesday evening to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for their refusal to turn over key documents related to the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.The citations for two cabinet officials, approved 230 to 198, will breathe new life into a dispute that has touched all three branches of government over why Trump administration officials pushed to ask census respondents if they were American citizens and what that question’s effect would be.Democrats investigating the issue believe that the documents and testimony being shielded would confirm that the administration’s long-stated rationale for collecting the data — to better enforce the Voting Rights Act — was merely a cover for a politically motivated attempt to eliminate noncitizens from population statistics used to allocate political representation, diminishing Democratic power.The Supreme Court hinted at that theory last month in a ruling about the citizenship question, when it rejected the administration’s stated reason for adding it as “contrived.” And in an unusual twist, President Trump himself all but confirmed those suspicions this month when he said of the citizenship question, “You need it for Congress, for districting.” Last week, he announced his government would give up the effort in light of the court’s decision.Democrats said Wednesday that their investigation would continue regardless, in an effort to vindicate Congress’s oversight authority and potentially neuter future attempts to discourage participation by noncitizens in the census.“It is bigger than the census. It is about protecting the integrity of the Congress of the United States of America,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the Oversight and Reform Committee chairman, said as he whipped up support on the House floor. “We need to understand how and why the Trump administration tried to add a question based on pretext so that we can consider reforms to ensure that this never happens again.”The Commerce Department, the Justice Department and the White House all swiftly issued statements condemning the vote as a bad-faith smear that ignored administration officials efforts to cooperate. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, called the action a “ridiculous and yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.” She added, “their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds.”Wednesday’s contempt vote formally authorized the oversight panel to take Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross to federal court to seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas for the material in question. A lawsuit is expected in the coming weeks, and the administration has maintained it is on firm legal footing in its position.It also leveled a stinging personal rebuke to Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross by formally referring them to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. There is no real risk the department will pursue the case — Mr. Barr is the head of the Justice Department — but only once before has Congress held in contempt a sitting member of a presidential cabinet: Eric H. Holder Jr., President Barack Obama’s first attorney general.The Justice and Commerce Departments maintain that in this case they have sought to fully cooperate within legal bounds with the oversight committee’s requests. Democrats, they argue, are more interested in a political clash that can attract attention from the news media and embarrass the administration than they are in actual fact-finding and prematurely abandoned the negotiating table.Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross dispatched a last-minute letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Wednesday urging her to call off the vote. The materials the committee had demanded, they said, would require violation of legal privileges and executive privilege.“The key remaining issue is how the departments and the committee will address the material that is protected by privileges that have been repeatedly affirmed by the courts,” they wrote. “There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve.”Republicans have backed them up at each step, arguing Democrats are abusing oversight powers to contest a reasonable policy goal. But Democrats easily defeated their efforts to kill the contempt citations and replace them with a bill requiring the inclusion of a citizenship question by law.“Why are they doing this? Why are they doing this? All because they don’t want a simple question on the census,” said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top ranking Republican on the oversight panel. “This resolution is ridiculous, and we should vote it down.”It is not unusual for Congresses and White Houses of opposing parties to face off over oversight demands, haggling over documents and witnesses. But there is scant precedent for the volume and intensity of the disputes between this Democratic House and Mr. Trump, whose administration has taken a dim view of Congress’s authority to compel executive branch cooperation.The House Judiciary Committee, for instance, has been locked in a dispute with the Justice Department and White House over access to evidence underlying Robert S. Mueller III’s report on Russian election interference and access to key government officials who served as witnesses to the former special counsel. It may soon spawn additional contempt votes and court action.And an effort by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to obtain Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns has already been redirected to federal court after the Treasury Department refused to comply with requests and subpoenas.Wednesday would be the first time the House actually voted to hold a government official in contempt in one of the fights. The Judiciary Committee recommended that the House do so with Mr. Barr in the dispute over Mr. Mueller’s evidence. But the two sides struck a last-minute deal to avoid a formal contempt vote and the House merely voted to authorize court action to enforce the subpoena.The only other direct precedent for Tuesday’s vote was in 2012, when Republicans then in control of the House held Mr. Holder in contempt in connection with requests for information about the botched Fast and Furious gun trafficking investigation. Republicans ended up suing the Obama administration in the case and ultimately prevailed, but the case took years to wind its way thought the courts and could have gone on longer if the Obama administration had continued to appeal.The outcome in the census case could take just as long, potentially outlasting Mr. Trump’s term unless the two sides reach an agreement.The Democrats specifically say the two cabinet secretaries “obstructed and delayed” an oversight committee investigation that began in January. Mr. Ross provided sworn testimony to the committee in March 2018 in which he said he had decided to add the question “solely” based on a December 2017 request from the Justice Department asking for data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.But documents revealed in court and evidence collected by the committee in interviews and document requests indicated that the decision may have been more complicated. The possibility of adding a citizenship question, long a dream of Republicans active in redistricting fights, was pitched to the Trump campaign, the evidence showed, and was discussed by White House officials in early 2017. Mr. Ross himself sought to add a citizenship question before the Justice Department request and personally sought its assistance in September 2017.When Mr. Cummings issued subpoenas for documents related to departmental decision making, neither the Justice Department nor the Commerce Department fully complied, he said, producing records that were heavily blacked out or already public.The United States used to include a citizenship question on all census forms, but since 1950, it has appeared only on a longer, more detailed questionnaire sent at random to a small number of households and not on the forms that most residents receive.The debate over the citizenship question is not an academic one. Government experts have estimated that asking respondents their citizenship status would scare many immigrants from responding to the census, which counts all people living in the United States, not just citizens. It could ultimately result in an undercount of about 6.5 million people, they say.States rely on raw population data, rather than eligible voters, to draw House districts and to determine access to federal social welfare programs. Democrats were fearful that a significant undercount could reduce their representation and affect how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending were distributed.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Advertisement

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.I’ve developed my own amateur NIE based on this information, and here’s the organization at the top of the list:The Republican Party. Shocking as that may seem — and your level of shock may vary widely depending on how closely you’ve been tracking the actions both center stage and behind the scenes of the rapidly toxifying Grand Ole Party — the real problem with this revelation is that we cannot actually do much about this threat in the classic manner. The threat from the right is the first national-level “insider threat” the United States has faced since the Civil War. It is insidious, asymmetric, powerful – and existential. How did I come to this conclusion? Through empirical evidence and specialized experience, using the same approach as when I helped draft a document seen by the most powerful men and women in the country. One of the effective modern techniques we’ve developed to deal with threats is intelligence analysis – in which we methodically examine all potential threats and categorize them for effective response.  Categorizations range from existential – such as that from thermonuclear war with the Soviet Union or global warming – to challenging – such as terrorism – to those of a merely nuisance variety. The NIE, like all intelligence products, is supposed to be: objective; non-political; current; empirically valid; and zero-based (starting without assumptions.)A part of categorization or as a next step is threat prioritization – in which we basically rank the range of threats we face so we can apply limited resources to bring down the risk. This is a necessary action, but one that is often not totally satisfactory to all citizens.  For instance, the shift we’ve had to take in response to terrorism – from total elimination of the threat to limiting its potential impact — does not appear to many Americans as a proportional response to the problem.  Nonetheless, from the resource and policy perspective, it is the right course of action.   Let me say it again: the Republican Party is the biggest threat the United States is facing. And without proper attribution, recognition, and a well-articulated and implemented counter-strategy, it could be terminal. There is no other reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts. An enemy of the United States might seek to sow discord between ethnic groups, or to wage a disinformation campaign, or to highlight moral inconsistencies that weaken the standing of the United States on the world stage. An enemy of the United States might try and degrade the capacity and public trust within our intelligence apparatus. It might use propaganda and weaponized  information. It might seek to engage in fraud or other criminal acts to sway an election in their favor. Does any of that sound familiar? The Republican Party has steadily embraced authoritarianism, suspect electoral tactics, and racism more and more over the past few decades. That process has been turbocharged with Trump at the helm of the party.We’re now seeing an explicit embrace of white supremacy. Denial in the face of climate change. Deliberate sowing of discord within the FBI and the CIA. Weakening of the rule of law. Brazen criminality. Removing funding for elections oversight. Blatant human rights abuses at the border. The explicit nature of these acts is the point. The Republicans mean to bludgeon any and all resistance to their reshaping of the nation’s institutions to their will. And so far, they’ve gotten away with it. Donald Trump and his coterie of criminals have done more in two years to weaken the United States than the Soviet Union was able to achieve in decades, a stolen gold medal in Olympic basketball notwithstanding. In other words, Americans have every right to fear the power and influence of the Republican Party – and it is in fact irrational to continue to downplay the threat even as most, including Nancy Pelosi and many Democrats, continue to do so.

The former ‘Daily Show’ host told Fox News that Paul was trying to “balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.”Senior WriterOne month ago, former Daily Show host Jon Stewart went on Fox News to shame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to protect 9/11 first responders. Wednesday afternoon, he was back on that network to give his fellow Republican senator from Kentucky a piece of his mind. In an interview with Bret Baier, Stewart immediately took aim at Rand Paul who, along with Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), blocked a Senate bill that would extend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, making the case that it should be offset by other spending cuts.  Responding directly to Paul, Stewart called his objection “absolutely outrageous,” adding, “Pardon me if I’m not impressed in any way by Rand Paul’s fiscal responsibility virtue signaling.” Stewart went on to condemn Paul for supporting President Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut that “added hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit” and now trying to “balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.” “Bret, this is about what kind of society we have,” a clearly furious Stewart continued. “At some point, we have to stand up for the people who have always stood up for us, and at this moment in time maybe cannot stand up for themselves due to their illnesses and their injuries. And what Rand Paul did today on the floor of the Senate was outrageous.” “He is a guy who put us in hundreds of billions of dollars in debt,” he said of Paul. “And now he’s going to tell us that a billion dollars a year over 10 years is just too much for us to handle? You know, there are some things that they have no trouble putting on the credit card, but somehow when it comes to the 9/11 first responder community—the cops, the firefighters, the construction workers, the volunteers, the survivors—all of a sudden we’ve got to go through this.” Appearing next to Stewart was 9/11 first responder and activist John Feal, who thanked the host and Fox News as a whole for being so “generous” with their time on this issue before calling Senators Paul and Lee “bottom-feeders” who “lack humanity” and “lack leadership.”Stewart said survivors like Feal and others shouldn’t have to “drag themselves back to Washington, put their hats in their hands and beg for something that this country should have done 14 years ago,” adding, “It’s an abomination.” 


We now have a new gross Trump rally crowd chant to replace “Lock Her Up!”We now have a new gross Trump rally crowd chant to replace “Lock Her Up!”During President Trump’s Wednesday night rally in Greenville, North Carolina, he took aim at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the Democratic congresswomen of color he told to “go back” to where “they came” from.“Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds,” the president said.The MAGA crowd knew just what to do next.“Send her back! Send her back! Send her back,” the audience chanted as Trump soaked it in for a few moments.Omar is a United States citizen. She moved from Somalia as a child and gained her citizenship as a teenager.Trump's rally occurs just days after he blasted off a series of racist tweets at the so-called Squad, a group of four progressive Democratic lawmakers that include Omar, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Following widespread outrage over the bigoted tweetstorm, the president has continued to double-down on his remarks and has repeatedly called out Omar by name, falsely accusing her of supporting Al Qaeda and hating Jewish people.As Republicans have largely stood by the president as he ramps up his racist attacks, the House of Representatives voted to condemn Trump over his comments. While the vote was largely down party lines, four Republicans and one independent (Justin Amash, who recently left the GOP) joined the Democrats in passing the resolution.

Jeffrey Epstein used a foreign passport with a fake name to enter several countries in the 1980s including the United Kingdom, Spain and Saudi Arabia, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.The questionable travel document was found inside a safe — along with $70,000 in cash and 48 loose diamonds — in the New York City home of the wealthy financier and accused sex trafficker. It contained a photo of Epstein with a different name and listed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia, according to prosecutors.Epstein's lawyers filed court papers Tuesday claiming he obtained the Austrian passport in 1982 for "personal protection" to be presented to "potential kidnappers, hijackers, or terrorists." The lawyers said Epstein's Jewish faith and substantial wealth made him a target while traveling in the Middle East.Epstein's attorneys also said that the government provided no evidence that he ever used the passport.But Wednesday, prosecutors did just that."In fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s," the court papers say.Prosecutors added that Epstein's lawyers have yet to explain some of the basic questions concerning the passport, including how he obtained it and whether he's a citizen of another country.Epstein's lawyers did not immediately return a request for comment.The travel document has become a key component of the government's argument for keeping Epstein locked up on charges alleging he sexually abused dozens of underage girls in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005.Prosecutors say it demonstrates Epstein's ability to obtain false travel documents and underscores his "serious risk of flight." They also point to his extraordinary wealth, access to private planes and limited family ties.Defense lawyers have asked the judge to allow Epstein to remain at his $77 million Manhattan mansion with electronic monitoring as the case plays out.A judge is expected to issue a ruling on the bail request Thursday.Epstein, who is being held at a federal prison in New York City, faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.Tom Winter is a New York-based correspondent covering crime, courts, terrorism, and financial fraud on the East Coast for the NBC News Investigative Unit.Rich Schapiro is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

And the Congress will.”Earlier this year, Congress approved a resolution to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war.Trump used the second veto of his presidency to quash the Yemen resolution. The Senate, where the resolution originated, did not muster the 67 votes needed to override the veto.Congress has been furious at Saudi Arabia over its killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.Khashoggi’s death compounded existing anger at Saudi Arabia over the Yemen civil war’s civilian deaths, the majority of which have been blamed on Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.Despite Congress already having registered its displeasure with the Yemen war powers vote in May, Secretary of State Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoPompeo changes staff for Russia meeting after concerns raised about top negotiator's ties: report Ben Carson: Trump is not a racist and his comments were not racist US bans top Myanmar generals from country over attacks on Rohingya Muslims  MORE invoked an emergency provision of the law governing arms sales to approve 22 deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without the typical 30-day congressional review period.The move infuriated lawmakers, who accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass Congress. Lawmakers had been blocking the sales from moving forward because of concerns about the civilian casualties in Yemen.The administration and its allies have argued the arms sales are necessary because of what they described as heightened threats from Iran.“Right now, as I speak, Iran is stretching its tentacles of terror across the Middle East,” Foreign Affairs ranking member Rep.

				Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.			
				Carolyn Kaster/AP/Shutterstock			Rand Paul supports adding to the national debt if it also means slashing the tax rate for corporate America. If it means paying for health care for ailing 9/11 first responders? That, the Republican from Kentucky has decided, is when enough if enough.On Wednesday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) asked the Senate for unanimous consent to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, which offers compensation to 9/11 survivors and first responders who have filed claims relating to various health problems they have experienced as a result of the attacks. Paul objected, citing the the rising national deficit and saying the spending should be offset by cuts elsewhere.	“It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this country,” he said. “We have a $22 trillion debt. We’re adding debt at about $1 trillion a year. Therefore, any new spending that we are approaching, any new program that is going to have the longevity of 70 or 80 years should be offset by cutting spending that is less valuable. We should at least be having this debate.”Paul’s objection forces the Senate to go through more procedural steps and votes to pass the compensation bill, but it appears the measure will still ultimately pass. A statement from Paul’s staff said his plan is not ultimately to block the aid, but to make sure it’s offset by spending cuts elsewhere.“Senator Paul is not blocking anything. He is simply seeking to pay for it. As with any bill, Senator Paul always believes it needs to be paid for. Senator Paul is simply offering an amendment, which other senators support, to pay for this legislation,” the statement read.In 2017, Paul voted in favor of Trump’s tax bill, which disproportionately benefitted the wealthiest Americans and cut the corporate tax rate nearly in half, from 35% to 21%. The Congressional Budget Office projects that bill will add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade.BREAKING: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has blocked an attempt to pass an extension of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, pointing to the country's growing debt and arguing that any new spending should be offset by cuts to other spending.

The need to do so was drawn into the mainstream last month when former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, backed by first responders, delivered an emotional, tear-filled plea in front of the House Judiciary Committee. A few days later, Stewart went on Fox News to attack Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for his indifference toward reauthorizing the fund, which is now co-sponsored by 73 of 100 senators.Paul is not among them.

The senator is happy to add to the debt when tax cuts are on the line, but sick 9/11 first responders can take a hike.Back in November 2017, Senator Rand Paul wrote an op-ed titled “Here’s why I plan to vote for the Senate tax bill (and my colleagues should step up).” In it, the lawmaker from Kentucky argued that even though he’d literally staked his reputation on railing against deficit spending, he would be casting a “yea” vote for a bill that would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Obviously, Paul was able to overlook the fact that the legislation went against everything he supposedly stood for because it involved a massive tax cut for corporate America. But apparently, when it comes to making exceptions to his faux principles, 9/11 victims dying of cancer don’t make the cut.Seeking to out-evil Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday, Paul made it clear that unless you’re a multinational being forced to pay a 35% tax rate, he doesn’t give a shit about your suffering, blocking an attempt by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to win the Senate’s consent to approve a House-passed bill that would fund the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund until fiscal 2090. Suddenly remembering that he claims to care about the debt and deficits, Paul objected to the bill, saying, “It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this country.” (Reminder: Paul rallied his colleagues around a bill that is projected to help push the deficit to $896 billion in 2019. But we digress.) “We have a $22 trillion debt,” Paul said, without a fraction of an iota of self-awareness. “We’re adding debt at about $1 trillion a year. Therefore any new spending that we are approaching, any new program that is going to have the longevity of 70 or 80 years, should be offset by cutting spending that is less valuable. We should at least be having this debate.”Paul’s decision to suddenly start caring about spending when 9/11 first responders’ lives are on the line means that the Senate will now have to go through additional procedural steps to pass the compensation bill, and while it’s nevertheless expected to pass, Paul’s ghoulish decision to give 9/11 victims the metaphorical finger did not go over well. After his objection, Gillibrand said she was “deeply disappointed” in his decision when the bill is “desperately needed and urgent.” (Later, a spokesperson for Paul insisted he “is not blocking anything,” but “simply seeking to pay for it.”)https://twitter.com/girlsreallyrule/status/1151552052453171201If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.Jeff Bezos: I’m spending my fortune on space because we’re turning earth into an uninhabitable hellhole“We humans have to go to space if we are going to continue to have a thriving civilization,” the Blue Origin founder said in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. “We have become big as a population, as a species, and this planet is relatively small. We see it in things like climate change and pollution and heavy industry. We are in the process of destroying this planet. And we have sent robotic probes to every planet in the solar system—this is the good one. So, we have to preserve this planet.” He added: “We send things up into space, but they are all made on earth. Eventually it will be much cheaper and simpler to make really complicated things, like microprocessors and everything, in space and then send those highly complex manufactured objects back down to earth, so that we don’t have the big factories and pollution generating industries that make those things now on earth. And earth can be zoned residential.” Or, if you want, you’ll be able to buy yourself a nice two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in space. “People are going to want to live on earth, and they are going to want to live off earth,” said Bezos, who sells roughly $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to fund Blue Origin. “There are going to be very nice places to live off earth as well. People will make that choice.”Trump’s tax cuts continue to pay off richly for middle classAnd by middle class we, of course, mean Wall Street:The five largest banks in the United States reaped tens of billions of dollars in profits in the first half of the year, thanks in part to a strong economy and to the lingering effects of President Trump’s tax cuts.Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have all seen their tax rates decline to 22 percent or less as a result of the cuts, compared with rates of around 30 percent three years ago, one of the most consistent sources of strength apparent in quarterly earnings reports issued this week. JPMorgan’s tax rate fell to just under 15 percent in this year’s second quarter, although the bank said it would probably inch higher later in the year. Wells Fargo’s tax rate for the quarter was just over 17 percent, and Bank of America’s was 18 percent. The reduced rates helped offset a general decline in Wall Street trading revenue and added some pep to what would have otherwise been unremarkable quarterly performances by most of the banks.For the second quarter, Bank of America raked in $7.3 billion, while JPMorgan brought in $9.7 billion and Goldman Sachs earned a nice round $9.5 billion. And shockingly, it seems unlikely that money will trickle down to average workers, as Trump and the GOP have promised. April data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the “big bonuses” corporations were supposed to dole out after receiving billions in tax breaks resulted in…a penny per worker and, presumably, a note about not spending it all in one place.Trump is pretty pleased with how his bigoted, inflammatory statements have worked outDespite the fact that a majority of the country thinks his racist tirade against four freshman congresswomen was “un-American,” and was officially censured by the House of Representatives last night, Donald Trump claims he’s thrilled by how the events of the past few days have panned out. “Let’s put it this way,” the president told reporter David Martosko on Wednesday by phone, “I’m not unhappy.” Arguing that Democrats have no other ammo against his stain of a presidency, he added, “The only thing they have, that they can do is, now, play the race card, which they’ve always done.”To be fair, it’s possible Trump is thrilled about officially being labeled an unrepentant racist because it gives him extra street cred with his base; a Reuters/Ipsos poll released yesterday showed support among Republicans “increased slightly” after he told Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib to “go back” to the “crime infested” countries they “originally came from.”Elsewhere!Ex-Banker Builds Billion-Dollar Fortune as Legal Pot Sweeps U.S. (Bloomberg)Ray Dalio says gold will be a top investment during upcoming ‘paradigm shift’ for global markets (CNBC)Netflix stock drops more than 10% as earnings show huge decline in new subscribers (MarketWatch)Use that ‘old age filter’ on FaceApp?

AdvertisementSupported byBy Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Nick CorasanitiThe Supreme Court of New Jersey, responding to a nationwide backlash over insensitive comments made by several judges in sexual assault cases, announced new mandatory training on Wednesday for judges across the entire system.The move came as one judge involved in one of the high-profile cases resigned and removal proceedings were initiated for another. James Troiano, the Monmouth County judge who recommended leniency for a 16-year-old boy accused of rape because the boy was from a “good family,” resigned from the bench, officials said.The comments by Judge Troiano, which were made in a 2018 ruling, were seen by advocates for sexual assault victims as emblematic of a legal system that is mired in bias and privilege, and has deterred victims from reporting assaults.Shortly after the comments became public in early July, elected officials called for the judge’s resignation, petitions circulated for his disbarment and a protest was held outside the Monmouth County courthouse where the judge had made the ruling. Judge Troiano and his family even received threats of violence.The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Judge Troiano, who had retired in late 2012, but continued to hear cases on a part-time basis, requested to step down. The court acceded and terminated his services effective immediately. A spokeswoman for the court said Mr. Troiano will keep his pension, which according to the state Treasury is calculated at 75 percent of his salary, for a total of $123,750.Also on Wednesday, the state Supreme Court ordered a new initiative to improve the training of judges in the areas of sexual assault, domestic violence, implicit bias and diversity.“The programs also will train judges in effective communication skills that will aid them in delivering clear decisions that are rooted in the law, respectful of victims, and understandable to the public while protecting the rights of the accused,” Glenn A. Grant, the acting administrative director of the courts, said in a statement.Under the new initiative, the courts will recess within the next 90 days for a mandatory full-day educational conference focused partly on sexual assault. Mandatory annual training sessions will be developed with subject matter experts to train judges and judiciary staff.The Supreme Court also announced that it would begin removal proceedings for Judge John F. Russo, who asked a woman if she had closed her legs to try to prevent an alleged sexual assault.“Because of the seriousness of the ethical violations here, it is appropriate for the Court to consider the full range of potential discipline, up to and including removal from office,” wrote Justice Stuart Rabner, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.In the order, Justice Rabner cited a report from the Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct that found Mr. Russo showed “an absolute disregard for the solemnity that must attend every court proceeding, particularly those involving such serious concerns as domestic violence.”The removal process for a judge in New Jersey involves a formal hearing before a panel of Supreme Court judges. The order also suspends Judge Russo without pay pending the outcome of removal proceedings.Lawyers for Mr. Russo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The controversy sparked by the two judges drew widespread condemnation from elected officials in New Jersey, many of whom called for the removal of both judges. On Wednesday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy released a statement praising the Supreme Court’s actions. “Unfortunately, the inexcusable actions of several judges over recent months have threatened this reputation for thoughtful and reasoned opinion, and common decency,” Mr. Murphy said. “I am gratified that Judge Troiano will no longer sit on the bench and that removal proceedings will begin against Judge Russo.”Judge Troiano, a longtime family court judge, made the comments in 2018 when deciding whether to try the accused teenager as an adult. Prosecutors had said the teenager sexually assaulted a visibly intoxicated 16-year-old girl at a party and recorded the act, sending the video to his friends, along with a text that said, “When your first time is rape.”Judge Troiano decided the boy should not be tried as an adult, but an appeals court sharply rebuked and overturned his decision in June.The appeals court warned Judge Troiano, 69, against showing bias toward affluent teenagers and said “the judge decided the case for himself.” Family court cases are typically confidential, but some of Judge Troiano’s comments became public in the appeals court’s 14-page ruling.In making his decision last year, Judge Troiano appeared to question the girl’s level of intoxication, cited the boy’s good grades and college prospects and drew distinctions between sexual assault and the “traditional case of rape” at gunpoint.In a two-hour decision, Judge Troiano questioned aloud whether prosecutors had adequately explained to the girl and her family that pressing charges would destroy the boy’s life.“He is clearly a candidate for not just college but probably for a good college,” the judge said.He added: “This young man comes from a good family who put him into an excellent school where he was doing extremely well. His scores for college entry were very high.”Judge Troiano retired in December 2012, but continued to work three days a week as a “recall” judge, occasionally filling in to help ease a backlog of court cases. There are currently 63 judges on recall in state Superior Court. Judge Troiano declined to comment through a family member.Last month, the appeals court also scolded a Middlesex County family court judge, Marcia Silva, who said during the sexual assault case of a 12-year-old girl that “beyond losing her virginity, the state did not claim that the victim suffered any further injuries, either physical, mental or emotional.”Officials have not taken any action against Judge Silva despite similar calls for her resignation.“The comments were victim-blaming and a manifestation of the fears that many survivors have when deciding how they want to proceed in the aftermath of an assault,” the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement last week referring to the cases before Judge Troiano and Judge Silva.Last week, the state’s top public defender came to the defense of Judges Troiano and Silva, issuing a rare public statement expressing concern on the impact the criticism of the judges could have on the judicial process.“Vilifying or seeking the removal of judges who make unpopular or even erroneous decisions threatens the independence of the judiciary,” said Joseph Krakora, the top public defender for New Jersey. “Judges are simply lawyers entrusted with the responsibility of deciding difficult cases. Litigants sometimes feel that their decisions are incorrect or unfair. That is why we have appellate courts.”Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 230 are reported to the police, 9 are referred to prosecutors and 5 will lead to a felony conviction, according to Department of Justice data analyzed by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.Local advocates had for years clamored for judges to be trained in how to treat sexual assault victims, and legislation had recently been introduced. Without naming judges by name, Mr. Grant, the active administrative director, said the trainings stem from “particular events” that “prompt us to engage in critical self-analysis that suggests the need to do more to instill the Judiciary’s longstanding guiding policies and principles into our daily practices.”Luis Ferré-Sadurní writes about housing in New York City for the Metro Desk.

Free movies on YouTubeJeffrey Epstein’s pilot deletes Instagram after Kellyanne Conway pic surfaces

captbigsky/Instagram

He was pictured with Trump’s longest-serving White House aide. The news cycles in the Trump era move so quickly that a story can be the only thing anyone is talking about one day, and totally forgotten the next. But the arrest of financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has managed to stick around since it first broke on July 6. Part of this can be attributed to the powerful people in Epstein’s orbit, and part of it to the sheer luridness of the charges against him, sexual trafficking young girls to his various properties, even after getting an apparent sweetheart deal… from a U.S. attorney later appointed to Trump’s cabinet. It’s a lot.In fact, it’s so much that a universe of conspiracy theories and hoaxes quickly emerged. Some pulled in accusations from the QAnon and Pizzagate spheres, including QAnon posts about supposed tunnels under Epstein’s properties and Satanic rituals involving sex and human sacrifice. QAnon is the ongoing conspiracy that maintains a secret group of deep state officials is working to undermine President Donald Trump. Others were the reflexive defenses of Trump supporters trying to put daylight between the president and Epstein. As the case has moved forward, more rumors and hoaxes have emerged, with many getting enormous attention in spite of being either speculation or already proven untrue.Here are more of the biggest Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories and hoaxes:  A few days after Epstein’s arrest, an Instagram picture emerged that appeared to show Epstein pilot Larry Visoski posing with senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway on Dec. 28, 2016, in Palm Beach—long after the last time Trump claims he spoke with Epstein. Visoski, going by the screen name “CaptBigDawg,” appears to be smiling as he posed with Conway, whom he called a “very Humble and gracious Lady [sic].” A day afer it started making the rounds, both it and Visoski’s Instagram page have been deleted. But Visoski definitely is (or was) Epstein’s personal pilot, and Conway was in Palm Beach at the time. Ohai, It's Larry Visoski, Jeffrey Epstein's chief pilot, hanging out with @KellyannePolls just before NYE 2016.Weird, huh?https://t.co/mY7JmGqZPU pic.twitter.com/D04xP9o9IZWhile the picture is almost certainly real, there’s no indication of anything sinister behind it, or any particular significance to it at all. It might be true that a senior Trump adviser met with the pilot of a convicted sex offender, but that doesn’t mean either Conway or Trump ever met with Epstein around the time it was taken. She might not have even known he had a connection to Epstein. It’s simply a picture of two people, not evidence of a sinister conspiracy or horrible crime. For the record, Trump was in Florida at the time—the 28th was the day of his bizarre press conference with Don King at Mar-A-Lago.With Epstein being held in the federally operated Manhattan Correctional Center, the massive blackout that hit Manhattan on July 13 was seen by QAnon believers as just a bit too convenient. Very quickly, conspiracy theories started flying that the blackout was pulled off by the deep state via either sabotage or an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) as a way of getting Epstein out of prison before he could start naming names.These blackouts in major cities are likely white hat EMP attacks to disable the security measures of hidden enemy facilities as part of ongoing raids by federal law enforcement in the wake of Epstein's arrest. We have never seen anything like this. #TheStormIsHereTo be clear, there is no evidence that the deep state used an EMP to shut down a fairly small part of the electricity in Manhattan. An actual EMP going off would devastate the entire city, and shut down every form of electronics—including the ubiquitous cell phones used to record the blackout’s aftermath. But the biggest element that falsifies this conspiracy is that the Manhattan Correctional Center is substantially far from the actual area that was blacked out—it’s in Lower Manhattan, while the blackout was localized to the west and south of Central Park, over six miles from the prison.Epstein remains in prison and was at a bail hearing after the blackout. So if it was meant to cover his escape, it was a miserable failure.Could the president’s racist tweets, directed this time at four outspoken first-term members of the House known as “the Squad,” be a clever ruse to shift media attention away from his former friend, and in particular, the lurid contents of Epstein’s safe? Trump’s Twitter feed gets outsized attention no matter what, and his exhortations that Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) should “go back to…the crime infested places from which they came” have suddenly become the biggest story going—a perch occupied last week by Epstein’s arrest.Since Epstein's safe was raided, Trump has gone full White Supremacist....coincidence? #RacistPresidentIt’s not in evidence either way, and it’s entirely possible Trump is doing this to divert attention away from Epstein’s crimes and his potential links to them. But it’s also not like this is something new for Trump, who began his campaign in 2015 with a speech declaring Mexico is “sending” rapists and drug dealers across the southern border. Maybe Epstein really did have diamonds and a fake Saudi passport in his safe, but Trump unleashes Twitter tirades at far more insignificant provocations. Finally, Epstein’s case will drag on for months and years—when it’s likely that Trump’s feud with “the Squad” will burn out far sooner. So if it’s meant to be a distraction, it’s not going to distract anyone for long.Some QAnon believers have moved on from the attempted breakout that never happened to claim that Epstein will be the first of the long-foretold military tribunals that will mark the beginning of Q’s purge, “the Storm.” Why? Because, as this anon claims, Epstein was arrested on his private airplane, and never touched U.S. soil—thereby making him subject to military law, not U.S. law. The trial of pedophiles and Democrats via military judgment, rather than civil courts, is a major part of the QAnon mythology, and if this turns out to be true it would go a long way toward proving the efficacy of Q’s claims.#Qanon #WWG1WGA #hereComesThePAIN#firstMilitaryTribunal??!!! pic.twitter.com/VcZ7bIE0k7It’s not clear from the reporting whether Epstein was actually arrested on his plane, or after having disembarked at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. It also doesn’t matter. An airport is not subject to either international or military law, while  U.S. law is clear that civilian courts will try civilians as long as they’re functioning. Military tribunals for non-combatants are illegal, and there’s no evidence that any contact Epstein is having with the justice system is taking place outside of normal American jurisprudence.  Assuming Epstein’s situation drags on without him pleading guilty, expect to become more lurid, and more conspiracy theories and hoaxes to emerge on both sides of the political aisle. Some will be nonsensical, and others will require a little more critical thinking to debunk. As always, be skeptical of anything you read about Epstein. READ MORE:Got five minutes?

												President Trump on Wednesday repeated the claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar committed immigration fraud by illegally marrying her brother.Trump made the statement while responding to a question from a reporter from the One America News Network before leaving for a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.Reporter Emerald Robinson asked the president “if the administration was looking into possible immigration fraud committed by Ilhan Omar for possibly marrying her brother.”“Well, there’s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it,” Trump said.“I hear she was married to her brother. You’re asking me a question about it. I don’t know, but I’m sure there’s somebody who will be looking at that,” he added.Trump’s statement comes amid his ongoing feud with a group of freshman congresswomen known as “the Squad,” which includes Omar. Last weekend, Trump wrote on Twitter that the congresswomen should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how​ it is done​.”Trump’s tweet prompted House Democrats to adopt a resolution condemning the statement as “racist.”The claim that Omar illegally wed her brother so he could gain American citizenship first surfaced on conservative blogs in 2016, when she was running for the Minnesota state legislature.In a statement that year, Omar called it “baseless rumors” that “are absolutely false and ridiculous.”Omar then said she had married her current partner, Ahmed Hirsi, in the eyes of her Muslim faith in 2002 — but never legally married him. Their partnership ended in 2008.Omar then legally married Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009, but that union ended in 2011, according to her statement.“Insinuations that Ahmed Nur Said Elmi is my brother are absurd and offensive,” she said at the time.The same year Elmi and Omar split, she reconciled with her first husband, and the pair are still together.

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats.  “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels. Matt Zapotosky and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.

Obviously, Paul was able to overlook the fact that the legislation went against everything he supposedly stood for because it involved a massive tax cut for corporate America. But apparently, when it comes to making exceptions to his faux principles, 9/11 victims dying of cancer don’t make the cut.Seeking to out-evil Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday, Paul made it clear that unless you’re a multinational being forced to pay a 35% tax rate, he doesn’t give a shit about your suffering, blocking an attempt by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to win the Senate’s consent to approve a House-passed bill that would fund the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund until fiscal 2090. Suddenly remembering that he claims to care about the debt and deficits, Paul objected to the bill, saying, “It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this country.” (Reminder: Paul rallied his colleagues around a bill that is projected to help push the deficit to $896 billion in 2019. But we digress.) “We have a $22 trillion debt,” Paul said, without a fraction of an iota of self-awareness. “We’re adding debt at about $1 trillion a year. Therefore any new spending that we are approaching, any new program that is going to have the longevity of 70 or 80 years, should be offset by cutting spending that is less valuable. We should at least be having this debate.”Paul’s decision to suddenly start caring about spending when 9/11 first responders’ lives are on the line means that the Senate will now have to go through additional procedural steps to pass the compensation bill, and while it’s nevertheless expected to pass, Paul’s ghoulish decision to give 9/11 victims the metaphorical finger did not go over well. After his objection, Gillibrand said she was “deeply disappointed” in his decision when the bill is “desperately needed and urgent.” (Later, a spokesperson for Paul insisted he “is not blocking anything,” but “simply seeking to pay for it.”)https://twitter.com/girlsreallyrule/status/1151552052453171201If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.Jeff Bezos: I’m spending my fortune on space because we’re turning earth into an uninhabitable hellhole“We humans have to go to space if we are going to continue to have a thriving civilization,” the Blue Origin founder said in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. “We have become big as a population, as a species, and this planet is relatively small. We see it in things like climate change and pollution and heavy industry. We are in the process of destroying this planet. And we have sent robotic probes to every planet in the solar system—this is the good one. So, we have to preserve this planet.” He added: “We send things up into space, but they are all made on earth. Eventually it will be much cheaper and simpler to make really complicated things, like microprocessors and everything, in space and then send those highly complex manufactured objects back down to earth, so that we don’t have the big factories and pollution generating industries that make those things now on earth. And earth can be zoned residential.” Or, if you want, you’ll be able to buy yourself a nice two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in space. “People are going to want to live on earth, and they are going to want to live off earth,” said Bezos, who sells roughly $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to fund Blue Origin. “There are going to be very nice places to live off earth as well. People will make that choice.”Trump’s tax cuts continue to pay off richly for middle classAnd by middle class we, of course, mean Wall Street:The five largest banks in the United States reaped tens of billions of dollars in profits in the first half of the year, thanks in part to a strong economy and to the lingering effects of President Trump’s tax cuts.Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have all seen their tax rates decline to 22 percent or less as a result of the cuts, compared with rates of around 30 percent three years ago, one of the most consistent sources of strength apparent in quarterly earnings reports issued this week. JPMorgan’s tax rate fell to just under 15 percent in this year’s second quarter, although the bank said it would probably inch higher later in the year. Wells Fargo’s tax rate for the quarter was just over 17 percent, and Bank of America’s was 18 percent. The reduced rates helped offset a general decline in Wall Street trading revenue and added some pep to what would have otherwise been unremarkable quarterly performances by most of the banks.For the second quarter, Bank of America raked in $7.3 billion, while JPMorgan brought in $9.7 billion and Goldman Sachs earned a nice round $9.5 billion. And shockingly, it seems unlikely that money will trickle down to average workers, as Trump and the GOP have promised. April data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the “big bonuses” corporations were supposed to dole out after receiving billions in tax breaks resulted in…a penny per worker and, presumably, a note about not spending it all in one place.Trump is pretty pleased with how his bigoted, inflammatory statements have worked outDespite the fact that a majority of the country thinks his racist tirade against four freshman congresswomen was “un-American,” and was officially censured by the House of Representatives last night, Donald Trump claims he’s thrilled by how the events of the past few days have panned out. “Let’s put it this way,” the president told reporter David Martosko on Wednesday by phone, “I’m not unhappy.” Arguing that Democrats have no other ammo against his stain of a presidency, he added, “The only thing they have, that they can do is, now, play the race card, which they’ve always done.”To be fair, it’s possible Trump is thrilled about officially being labeled an unrepentant racist because it gives him extra street cred with his base; a Reuters/Ipsos poll released yesterday showed support among Republicans “increased slightly” after he told Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib to “go back” to the “crime infested” countries they “originally came from.”Elsewhere!Ex-Banker Builds Billion-Dollar Fortune as Legal Pot Sweeps U.S. (Bloomberg)Ray Dalio says gold will be a top investment during upcoming ‘paradigm shift’ for global markets (CNBC)Netflix stock drops more than 10% as earnings show huge decline in new subscribers (MarketWatch)Use that ‘old age filter’ on FaceApp?

The senator is happy to add to the debt when tax cuts are on the line, but sick 9/11 first responders can take a hike.Back in November 2017, Senator Rand Paul wrote an op-ed titled “Here’s why I plan to vote for the Senate tax bill (and my colleagues should step up).” In it, the lawmaker from Kentucky argued that even though he’d literally staked his reputation on railing against deficit spending, he would be casting a “yea” vote for a bill that would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade.

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats.  “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels. Matt Zapotosky and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.

The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats.  “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels.

"Go back to Africa."

That was the insult that Ebrima Jallow said he heard repeatedly from his supervisor and fellow co-workers while working at the Walmart in Landover Hills, Maryland.

Despite his recent promotion to the position of Asset Protection Coordinator, overseeing security and theft prevention efforts at the facility, Jallow said the attacks he faced were relentless, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf by the federal government's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2013.

Jallow, a Muslim who was born in Gambia, accused his store manager and fellow co-workers of repeated instances of harassment and intimidation based on his national origin and religion.

In meetings and day-to-day interactions with fellow employees, Jallow said he was mocked for his accent and told that "all Muslims do is blow up buildings and people."

Employees also allegedly told him he should "go back to Africa."

After reporting the harassment, Jallow alleged he was retaliated against and put on a one-year "coaching period" where other employees were told not to work with him.

Following a nearly two-year court battle, Jallow was paid $75,000 in damages from Walmart, and in a settlement the company committed to providing anti-discrimination and harassment training to employees.
Some Republican leaders have rushed to President Donald Trump's defense following his use of an age-old racist trope to attack four minority Congresswomen -- saying they should "go back" to their countries of origin. And in interviews with several of Trump's supporters planning to attend his campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday, many said they took no issue with the president's comments.

"I've been saying it for years," Michael Audette, a resident from Elizabeth City, North Carolina, told ABC News.So interesting to see "Progressive" Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly..........and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how....
But the insult has been referred to in numerous court cases brought by the government over the past decade as a textbook definition of illegal harassment in the workplace.

Eric Bachman, a former Department of Justice Civil Rights Division prosecutor who specializes in anti-discrimination cases, told ABC News that the president's tweets would be "as close to a slam-dunk discriminatory claim as you can get" if he had uttered them as the head of a private company rather than as chief executive of the United States.

"Frankly, if there was a board of directors, they would be taking action to fire him if he were the president of a company," Bachman said. "This would almost certainty violate Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and a host of other civil rights-related laws."

"Just his statements alone, would be really strong evidence of a hostile work environment that he treats employees who are not white differently than he would treat white employees," Bachman added.

In the days since the president's tweet, civil rights groups have pointed out the sordid history of the "go back to where you came from" racial epithet and its expansion as an insult beyond immigrant groups to anyone who may be a person of color.

"National origin discrimination involves treating people (applicants or employees) unfavorably because they are from a particular country or part of the world, because of ethnicity or accent, or because they appear to be of a certain ethnic background (even if they are not)," EEOC spokesperson Kimberly Smith-Brown said in a statement, emailed to ABC News on Wednesday.

The EEOC, which declined to comment directly on the president's tweets, is the federal entity tasked with carrying out enforcement of the nation’s workplace anti-discrimination laws.

Below are just a few examples of cases that the EEOC has pursued in the last 15 years in which alleged harassment from employees mirrored the language from the president's tweets. Except where identified, the cases primarily resulted in settlements where the companies were not compelled to admit to any wrongdoing.
1) California hospital settled lawsuit in 2012 for nearly $1 million after Filipino-Americans said they were told to go back to the Philippines, among other instances of harassment 

The EEOC brought a lawsuit on behalf of nearly 70 Filipino-American hospital workers at California's Delano Regional Medical Center who reported that they were subject to harassment and discrimination based on their national origin. The workers alleged that fellow staffers "constantly made fun of their accents," and some "were told to go back to the Philippines."

The EEOC argued that the employees' conduct violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and the hospital settled the case for $975,000, distributed between the approximately 70 employees, while committing to develop stronger anti-harassment rules in the hospital.

2) Nevada U-Haul company sued in 2006 after Hispanic workers were told "go back to Mexico" 

In 2006, the EEOC brought a lawsuit against a U-Haul company in Nevada where it charged that Hispanic and Asian/Filipino employees were being subject to bigoted harassment based on their race and/or national origin. The Hispanic employees reported that they were told by some of their fellow employees to "go back to Mexico."

The Nevada U-Haul company settled the case for $153,000 and agreed to provide discrimination prevention training to its employees.

3) Car dealership sued in 2004 by a Muslim immigrant from India who said he was told by his coworkers that he should "just go back where [he] came from" 

The Houston office of the EEOC brought a lawsuit in 2004 against a car dealership, accused by a former Muslim immigrant employee of subjecting him to a hostile work environment. The man, Mohammad Rafiq, said he was fired for complaining about his supervisors and fellow employees' behavior, alleging that they had told him, "This is not your Islamic state or your India, where you came from," and that a separate colleague had specifically asked him, "Why don't you go back to where you came from since you believe what you believe?"

The company eventually settled the lawsuit as it started to move its way up through the appeals process. They signed a consent decree that required them to make annual compliance reports, apologize and pay $13,500 in damages to Rafiq and provide training to employees.

4) In 2011, New York University settled a lawsuit for $210,000 after African employee called "monkey" and told to "go back to the jungle" 

The EEOC announced in 2011 that it had settled a lawsuit with New York University over complaints from an employee, who was a native of Ghana, that said he had been called a "monkey," and told to "go back to the jungle" by a mailroom supervisor. The university agreed to pay the employee $210,000 in lost wages and compensation for the moral distress from the harassment, and also committed to initiating "university-wide enhanced policies and compliant procedures" intended to prevent further, similar harassment from taking place.

"Harassment based on national origin and race is still all too common in today’s workplace," Elizabeth Grossman, regional attorney of the EEOC New York District Office said in a statement announcing the settlement. "EEOC will continue to aggressively expose and remedy such conduct, no matter where it occurs. No employer is above the law."

5) California restaurant paid $165,000 to a dining room manager who was told to "go back to your country" 

In 2007, the EEOC sued the California restaurant Albion River Inn after an Arab restaurant manager was fired for refusing to apologize to a customer who had told him to "go back to [his] country." The dining manager said in the suit he was sticking up for a waiter from Tunisia who the customer had physically pushed and was berating for his limited English-speaking abilities. When the customer returned to the restaurant the next evening, the manager asked him not to continue his harassment of his employees -- but the customer allegedly responded by attacking the manager's national origin, saying among other insults, "I fought two wars to get rid of people like you!"

After firing the manager for refusing to write an apology note to the customer, the restaurant agreed to pay $165,000 in relief and committed to give employees non-discrimination training.


WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps has issued a cease-and-desist letter to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., for using the official Corps emblem and phrase on campaign mailers that link his likely 2020 opponent and two Democratic congresswomen to terror.In a letter to Hunter obtained by NBC News, the Marine Corps Trademark Licensing Office tells the congressman, "It has come to our attention that your campaign is using the official USMC Eagle, Globe and Anchor (Emblem) and the phrase 'No Better Friend, NO Worse Enemy' (Phrase) as an integral part of your political campaign, namely, on at least one fundraising mailer to your constituents."The letter, dated Tuesday, demands that Hunter's campaign "immediately remove the Emblem and the Phrase from its mailers, and, without limitation, from all other campaign materials including websites and other instances where the Emblem or the Phrase are being used. We also request that you provide us with a timetable as to your compliance with our requests."Click here to read the letter.A spokesperson for Hunter said that the Hunter campaign "was made aware of the concerns expressed and the request made by the U.S. Marine Corps not to include any of its copyrighted material in his campaign pieces.""The campaign immediately complied and is taking all appropriate measures to ensure this matter is addressed appropriately and thoroughly."The mailer, which some have already called Islamophobic, is written in Hunter's voice and targets Ammar Campa-Najjar, who ran against him in 2018 and plans to run again in 2020, and Democratic House members Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — two of the congresswomen recently attacked on Twitter by President Donald Trump. The mailer calls them "radical democrats" who "want you to forget their anti-Semitism or Family-Terrorist Ties!"Hunter adds, "But as a Marine I'll never forget the 1983 Beirut bombings and the 1972 Olympic murders!"Hunter served in the Marine Corps from 2001 and 2005 and was deployed to Iraq. As a reserve officer from 2005 to 2017, he was recalled to active duty in Afghanistan, reaching the rank of major. He has represented the San Diego area in Congress since 2009, first in the 52nd District and then in the 50th.He currently faces federal charges of wire fraud, campaign finance violations, falsifying records and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts and has argued the charges are politically motivated. In June, federal prosecutors alleged in court documents that Hunter had used campaign funds to pursue extramarital affairs with five women while in Congress.Campa-Najjar said in a statement to NBC 7 San Diego, "The closer Duncan Hunter gets to his criminal trial, the more absurd his lies and racist attacks become. At this point, it's pretty clear that Congressman Hunter has lost all ability to tell the difference between right and wrong, fact and fiction."In a statement to NBC News, Marine Corps spokesman Lt. Col. Stuart Fugler said, "The Eagle, Globe, and Anchor is a trademark of the Marine Corps protected by Federal law. In accordance with 10 U.S. Code § 7881, the seal and emblem should not be used in conjunction with any political activities.""The Marine Corps is taking appropriate action to address the referenced mailers," Fugler said.The letter closed by noting that Hunter is welcome to "simply and accurately state" that he is a Marine Corps veteran and offered Duncan an alternative "Marine Veteran" logo to use to indicate "pride in service."Hunter's spokesperson said the campaign has always used the required disclaimer on campaign materials as required by the Pentagon. The disclaimer says, "Duncan. D. Hunter was a Major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., for using the official Corps emblem and phrase on campaign mailers that link his likely 2020 opponent and two Democratic congresswomen to terror.In a letter to Hunter obtained by NBC News, the Marine Corps Trademark Licensing Office tells the congressman, "It has come to our attention that your campaign is using the official USMC Eagle, Globe and Anchor (Emblem) and the phrase 'No Better Friend, NO Worse Enemy' (Phrase) as an integral part of your political campaign, namely, on at least one fundraising mailer to your constituents."The letter, dated Tuesday, demands that Hunter's campaign "immediately remove the Emblem and the Phrase from its mailers, and, without limitation, from all other campaign materials including websites and other instances where the Emblem or the Phrase are being used. We also request that you provide us with a timetable as to your compliance with our requests."Click here to read the letter.A spokesperson for Hunter said that the Hunter campaign "was made aware of the concerns expressed and the request made by the U.S. Marine Corps not to include any of its copyrighted material in his campaign pieces.""The campaign immediately complied and is taking all appropriate measures to ensure this matter is addressed appropriately and thoroughly."The mailer, which some have already called Islamophobic, is written in Hunter's voice and targets Ammar Campa-Najjar, who ran against him in 2018 and plans to run again in 2020, and Democratic House members Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — two of the congresswomen recently attacked on Twitter by President Donald Trump. The mailer calls them "radical democrats" who "want you to forget their anti-Semitism or Family-Terrorist Ties!"Hunter adds, "But as a Marine I'll never forget the 1983 Beirut bombings and the 1972 Olympic murders!"Hunter served in the Marine Corps from 2001 and 2005 and was deployed to Iraq. As a reserve officer from 2005 to 2017, he was recalled to active duty in Afghanistan, reaching the rank of major. He has represented the San Diego area in Congress since 2009, first in the 52nd District and then in the 50th.He currently faces federal charges of wire fraud, campaign finance violations, falsifying records and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts and has argued the charges are politically motivated. In June, federal prosecutors alleged in court documents that Hunter had used campaign funds to pursue extramarital affairs with five women while in Congress.Campa-Najjar said in a statement to NBC 7 San Diego, "The closer Duncan Hunter gets to his criminal trial, the more absurd his lies and racist attacks become. At this point, it's pretty clear that Congressman Hunter has lost all ability to tell the difference between right and wrong, fact and fiction."In a statement to NBC News, Marine Corps spokesman Lt. Col. Stuart Fugler said, "The Eagle, Globe, and Anchor is a trademark of the Marine Corps protected by Federal law. In accordance with 10 U.S. Code § 7881, the seal and emblem should not be used in conjunction with any political activities.""The Marine Corps is taking appropriate action to address the referenced mailers," Fugler said.The letter closed by noting that Hunter is welcome to "simply and accurately state" that he is a Marine Corps veteran and offered Duncan an alternative "Marine Veteran" logo to use to indicate "pride in service."Hunter's spokesperson said the campaign has always used the required disclaimer on campaign materials as required by the Pentagon. The disclaimer says, "Duncan. D. Hunter was a Major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. Use of his military rank, job titles and photographs in uniform does not imply endorsement from the Department of Defense or the Marines."Mosheh Gains is a Pentagon producer for NBC News.© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL


France’s famous Louvre Museum has reportedly scrubbed the Sackler family’s name from its walls, in effect removing any physical trace of its ties to the billionaire family that owns opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma.The art philanthropist family’s name was quietly removed from a major wing devoted to eastern antiquities over the past couple of weeks, The New York Times reported Wednesday. This Paris museum’s wing had been known as the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities since 1997.A plaque honoring the family’s donations to the museum was also removed from the gallery’s entrance. Other mentions of the “Sackler Wing” throughout the museum were covered with tape, the Times reported.There is also no mention of the Sackler Wing on the museum’s website.A representative of the museum, confirming the names’ removal in a statement to The Guardian, said it was removed because it had exceeded a time limit.“The Theresa and Mortimer Sackler foundation supported the refurbishment of rooms of Persian and Levantine art in the period 1996 to 1997. Since then, there has been no other donation from the Sackler family,” the statement read. “On 10 October 2003, the museum board decided to limit the duration period of named rooms to 20 years. This donation is more than 20 years old, the name-period is therefore legally closed and these rooms no longer carry the Sackler name.”The scrubbing follows major museums in Europe and New York City announcing in recent months that they will no longer accept donations from the family. This includes New York’s Guggenheim Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Many of the museums have said that they will not be removing the Sackler name or changing it, however, according to the Times.The Louvre’s action also follows a July 1 protest at the Paris museum demanding that it remove the Sackler name. Protesters unfurled a large red-and-black banner reading, “Take down the Sackler name” before the iconic glass Louvre Pyramid. They also carried signs with statements such as “Shame on Sackler” in French.News of the Louvre’s separation from the Sacklers came the same week that federal data revealed that drugmakers and distributors increased shipments of opioid painkillers to pharmacies across the U.S. from 2006 to 2012 as the nation’s addiction crisis intensified.Over that seven-year period, there were more than 100,000 overdose deaths from the prescription drugs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.According to a Forbes report, the highly addictive Purdue Pharma painkillers have generated a $13 billion net worth for the Sackler clan.Purdue Pharma in 2007 was hit with a $635 million federal fine for falsely claiming its most widely known drug, OxyContin, was not as addictive as earlier opioids.A review by The Washington Post published Wednesday found that Purdue’s pills accounted for just 3% of the prescription opioids sold during that seven-year period. 


The president* is proud of the monster he has created. He glories in the destruction and the almighty rage.By now, unfortunately, a 'tween girl at El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago's little exercise in apartheid cosplay has been hauled into the national spotlight because she happened to be standing behind him when the lizard-brained chant of "send her back" erupted in reference to Rep. Ilhan Omar, a sitting member of the United States Congress. Because of the wizardry of modern video technology, television had zoomed right in on her as she slowly picks up the chant with no apparent enthusiasm. She then became little more than an object lesson. I wish her well. I hope she grows up to be Dorothy Day. I hope she grows up to be Exene Cervenka, if that's what she wants. I hope she grows up happy and at peace with the world. I hope she grows up in a country where incitement-to-riot isn't a net-plus in presidential elections. I hope, but it's getting harder by the hour.This was a racist speech down to its last dipthong. This was a fascist rally down to its bones. You don't have to be even a casual student of history to recognize that, because, somewhere deep in all of us, is this same angry political Id, this fear and distrust of the other tribe just over the misty mountains. In April, in a cave in the Phillippines, researchers discovered evidence of a new species of ancient hominid, Homo luzonensis. For years now, scientists have discovered that the evolution of human beings was not as straightforward a line as had been thought. There were other species of the genus Homo that never made it this far, either because they were bred out of their distinct existence, or because they were crowded out by a more dominant species. Whatever ferocious genetic and biological imperatives made Homo sapiens survive long enough to invent frozen yogurt and produce Donald Trump are still there in all of us. We recognize this fact, even if only subliminally. The best of us regard it with a healthy fear as something to be controlled. The worst of us act on it, and other people end up dead. And some of us tease it out of people and do so for their own power and profit, and don't care if they can control the results as long as they get theirs. Poets and novelists have made it their meat for centuries now. In 1818, Mary Shelley published her Frankenstein Or, The Modern Prometheus. By the end, both man and monster are destroyed. Victor Frankenstein laments:But his creation has the right of it, and understands humanity better than does the man who brought him to life again. The president* has a predator's gift for bringing out the native self-destruction in people for his own profit. What he has done in the last three years has been his masterwork in this regard. He doesn't plague himself with doubt about what he's creating around him. He is proud of his monster. He glories in its anger and its destruction and, while he cannot imagine its love, he believes with all his heart in its rage.  He is Frankenstein without conscience. All of that is going to be on vivid display over the next 18 months or so, just as it was on vivid display Wednesday night in North Carolina. The details are already so well-known as to beggar repeating, but what existed in that hall exists all around us now. As a nation, in our politics, we are both Frankenstein and Creature as one, and the president* seems to be the only one who grasps this basic fact, grasps it well enough to use as both sword and shield. I hope that young girl comes one day to realize fully what happened around her on Wednesday night, and to learn from it and to grow away from it. I hope, but it gets harder by the hour.


AUGUSTA, Maine — More Mainers disapproved of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins than approved of her in the second quarter of 2019 for the first time in more than two years of polling by a national firm in perhaps the best sign yet for Democrats in an uphill bid to oust her in 2020.Collins, a Republican, became a top target for Democrats after her October vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Next year’s campaign is tracking to be the most expensive in Maine history, with Collins raising nearly $6.5 million by June’s end to $1 million in 10 days for House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, one of four Democrats running. [Subscribe to our free morning newsletter and get the latest headlines in your inbox]The level of the threat to Collins, who long polled as Maine’s most popular politician and won her fourth term in 2014 with more than two-thirds of votes, has been difficult to discern, but online polling from Morning Consult shows a 22-percentage point drop in approval for Collins between the beginning of 2017 and the second quarter of 2019.Data from the latest quarter, released Tuesday, pegged Collins at 45 percent approval and 48 percent disapproval, with an error margin of 2 percentage points. She had a 67 percent approval rating in the first quarter of 2017 and was measured at 52 percent approval and 39 percent disapproval in the first three months of this year.The Kavanaugh vote has seemingly led Collins to lose Democrats, while winning back Republicans who saw her as not conservative enough, such as in 2017 after she voted to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Democrats opposed her by a net margin of 40 percentage points in the latest survey, while Republicans back her by a 27-point margin.It’s the second poll this year to show growing voter dissatisfaction with Collins, after one released in May by Critical Insights. That looked like an outlier at the time, compared with a March poll from Pan Atlantic Research pegging her at 62 percent approval, but another June survey from Florida-based Gravis Marketing showed her at 48 percent approval and 48 percent disapproval.For now, Collins remains favored to win a fifth term: In head-to-head polling against Gideon, the incumbent led with 51 percent of votes to Gideon’s 29 percent in the Pan Atlantic poll and with 52 percent to Gideon’s 36 percent in the more recent Gravis survey.Gideon is running for the Democratic nomination against Hallowell lobbyist and former gubernatorial candidate Betsy Sweet and the lesser-known Saco lawyer Bre Kidman and retired Air Force major general Jonathan Tracey of Oxford. Collins faces a longshot primary challenge from conservative activist Derek Levasseur of Fairfield.U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was pegged as the most popular of the nation’s senators in the Morning Consult survey with 62 percent approval. Democrat Janet Mills was in the middle of the pack among governors at 50 percent approval to 40 percent disapproval. That latter figure spiked from 30 percent in 2019’s first quarter.

                        Congress 
                    By SARAH FERRIS, HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN07/18/2019 10:43 AM EDT
                    Updated 07/18/2019 05:48 PM EDTHouse Democrats erupted in fury Thursday over President Donald Trump’s attacks on freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar at his reelection rally, fearful that crowd chants of “send her back” have personally endangered her and her family. Senior Democrats are now calling for authorities to evaluate security for Omar (D-Minn.), as well as the three other lawmakers who Trump called out by name at his Wednesday night rally in North Carolina — warning that Trump has escalated the risk of threats or even acts of violence toward the four minority freshmen.Story Continued Below“It’s crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger,” said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus. “He has threatened the safety of a member of Congress. That takes this to a whole different level.”“It’s bad enough that the president didn’t stop the chant last night. But he started it. It’s instilling fear, it’s going to instill violence,” added Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), the House’s No. 4 Democrat.Trump disavowed the "send her back" chant on Thursday, telling reporters, “I was not happy with it. I disagree with it.” The chant started as Trump was falsely claiming that Omar praised Al-Qaeda — an untruth he has repeated several times in recent days — and the president then paused his speech for several seconds as the audience continued. Omar told reporters Thursday that she wasn't worried about her personal safety but feared for Americans of color who she thinks could become a target after Trump's comments. "When you have a president who clearly thinks someone like me should go back, the message that he’s sending is not for me, it’s to every single person who shares an identity with me," she said. 
                                The Minnesota Democrat also warned of the dangers of bigotry.“Racism distracts, racism hurts, racism kills,” Omar said. “What I’m going to be busy doing is uplifting people and making sure that they understand here in this country we are all Americans, we are all welcome regardless of what he says.”Democrats' public reaction Thursday comes as an internal debate is playing out within the caucus. Lawmakers are divided over how to respond to Trump if he continues to attack the four high-profile freshman congresswomen, making it a dominant theme of his campaign. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of the lawmakers Trump railed against Wednesday night and in tweets over the weekend, said she has concerns over her safety and is discussing with Democrats whether to ask for additional security. “This president is evolving, as predicted, deeper into the rhetoric of racism which evolves into violence,” she said. "We are not in politics anymore. We are in racism — really we’re talking about fascistic government." Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats spoke with the Sergeant-at-Arms office before Wednesday night “about making sure that our members have what they need for their protection."House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) on Thursday sent his second letter in four days to Capitol Police, urging them to reevaluate their security protocols for Omar and the other freshmen.“There are some people who are easily influenced, and I’m afraid the president is part and parcel to the potential danger of those members of Congress. So we’ll have it looked at,” Thompson said in an interview Thursday.House Democrats overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to condemn Trump's racist remarks against Omar, Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), in which he said the four women of color should "go back" to another country. But the issue continued to dominate the week, overshadowing a victory for House Democrats Thursday when the caucus overwhelmingly passed a universal minimum wage bill, fulfilling a major campaign promise after months of private battles between liberals and moderates. "The president is a bully, I think the president is ignorant. And it is a difficult half-full, half-empty [glass situation] because we know this," said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) about the internal debate over how to continue to respond to Trump. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), leader of House Democrats' messaging arm, said the chants were one of the "most vile, repulsive, disgraceful, un-American things I’ve ever seen in my life." But, he added, Democrats knew when they passed the resolution earlier this week it was unlikely to deter Trump. "We did what Congress can do. We did a strong resolution of condemnation," he said. "I don’t think anyone who voted for the resolution of condemnation thought for a moment it would change his behavior.”In the meantime, senior Democrats are focusing on the most immediate issue at hand — whether additional security precautions should be taken to protect the four congresswomen. 
                                "If I were her I would immediately call the FBI and say what do I need for protection," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). "It’s hard to believe she’s not going to get threats coming out of a rally last night.”House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries also suggested Thursday that the four freshmen might require more security in light of Trump’s attacks, with a crowd of thousands chanting to “send her back.”“We need to make sure that every single member of the House Democratic caucus, particularly those who have been viciously targeted by Donald Trump, including at the rally last night, are safe and have the protection that they need,” Jeffries said. Other Democrats responded with rage at Trump’s comments at the capacity-crowd rally at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., where he said the freshmen lawmakers “hate our country.” Then he added: “You know what? If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it” — prompting the raucous crowd into chants.Three of the progressive freshman lawmakers were born in America and Omar, who emigrated from Somalia as a child, became a citizen in 2000 at age 17. But Democrats say his rhetoric at Wednesday's rally, where he encouraged crowd chants, crossed yet another line as they feared a rise in personal threats against the four lawmakers of color, including two of Congress's first Muslim women.“The president’s comments are extremely dangerous to any person that looks like me. The fact that her continued to incite his supporters the way his just tells me that he frankly doesn’t give a damn about the safety of Americans,” Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) said.“Dangerous, obscene, racist, disgusting, quite frankly un-American,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said of the comments.Andrew Desiderio and Burgess Everett contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 07/18/2019 09:49 AM EDTThe Palm Beach County GOP disinvited Anthony Scaramucci from addressing its annual fundraising event after the short-lived White House communications director criticized President Trump’s “racially charged” tweets saying four members of Congress who are women of color should leave the United States.“He suggested the president’s comments were racist and that he was becoming a racist. Our board was infuriated,” said Michael A. Barnett, the Republican Party chairman in the county, home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago getaway.Story Continued Below“We believe the tweets were not racist, the president is not racist and that Scaramucci’s comments were unfair,” Barnett, who is African American, said.“I am sorry that I was canceled,” he told POLITICO. “Mike Barnett must like and condone racist comments. Someone with more courage and less political expediency would call it for what it is and ask it to stop.”Barnett made his comments to POLITICO on Thursday morning after emailing Scaramucci that he was no longer invited to speak at the Aug. 15 event, called “Lobsterfest,” becasue of the comments."I don't think the president is a racist," Scaramucci first told the BBC on Tuesday. "But here's the thing, if you continue to say and act in that manner, then we all have to look at him and say, ‘OK, well, maybe you weren't a racist, but now you're turning into one.‘"Scaramucci has repeated his criticisms on Twitter and in cable news interviews, including a CNN appearance Thursday morning in which he theorized Trump’s attacks on the four congresswomen — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan— could propel the president to a second term.
                                The TV appearances and direct criticisms, according to a longtime Trump adviser, have left the president “furious” with Scaramucci. It’s not the first time. Scaramucci lasted just 10 days as White House communications director and was fired after crudely criticizing Trump loyalists.Now that Scaramucci has been disinvited from the Aug. 15 Palm Beach County GOP fundraiser, two longtime Trump allies remain: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and political operative Roger Stone, who was ordered by a judge Tuesday to stop using social media and to stop discussing a criminal case against him. Stone refused comment; Gaetz couldn’t be reached.The Palm Beach County Republican Party is so sensitive to criticisms of the president that members were worried about inviting South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to deliver a keynote address at a Lincoln Day dinner fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in March.“Graham had been critical of the president and there was the same concern,” Barnett said, noting that Graham didn’t make a scene. But Scaramucci made it clear that he could be a problem.“We felt we had no choice,” Barnett said.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    By ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN07/18/2019 09:00 AM EDTTwo in three Americans support statehood for the island of Puerto Rico, according to a Gallup Poll released Thursday morning.The 66 percent support for admitting the island as the 51st state is consistent with polling dating to the early 1960s. Support is highest among Democrats, younger voters, and nonwhite voters. But while nearly half of Republicans also back the proposal, the party’s leaders do not.Story Continued BelowPresident Donald Trump, who has disparaged Puerto Rico’s leadership and faced criticism for the federal government’s slow response to devastating Hurricane Maria, has said he is an "absolute no" on Puerto Rico statehood. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said granting the island statehood and full representation in Congress would be “full-bore socialism.” The high level of public support for Puerto Rico statehood stands in stark contrast to the public’s overwhelmingly negative views on statehood for Washington, D.C., which most voters, including most Democrats, said they oppose in another recent Gallup Poll, and comes as political and legal turmoil rocks Puerto Rico.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, a statehood advocate, is facing massive protests against his administration and calls to resign over leaked text messages and chats in which he disparaged political rivals in offensive terms. 
                                While the island’s status has not yet become a major debate in the 2020 election cycle, the large Puerto Rican population in the key swing state of Florida may force candidates to go on the record on the question. Several Democratic contenders have already made campaign stops in Puerto Rico, and if the island moves its presidential primary up to March, its fate may take on even greater importance in the presidential race.

Donald Trump stood there Wednesday night behind a lectern, silent, as a crowd of Americans at his rally erupted in a chant directed at a Somali-born Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota: “Send her back! Send her back! Send her back!”It was chilling. An angry mob wanting an American citizen whose views they disagree with run out of the country. It’s the kind of thing that gets out of hand. It’s the kind of thing that gets people killed.Trump lit the racist fire that led to those chants earlier this week, sending a series of tweets telling Rep. Ilhan Omar and three other Democratic congresswomen, all women of color, to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” a textbook racist trope.Coward that he is, Trump squawked defensively, claiming his tweets weren’t racist and, heck, he doesn’t have a racist bone in his body! So why didn’t he stop those chants Wednesday night? Why didn’t he put out the fire he lit?Racists tend to be cowardly like that, happy to spout hateful rhetoric but unwilling to admit they flat-out hate — or fear — people different from them.Own it, man. Without conviction, you’re just peddling snake oil.But no, Trump won’t fess up. And, as we learned this week, neither will the Republicans who march in lockstep with him. They saw no racism. Anyone calling Trump a racist is the real racist, right? Or maybe an anti-Semite, which, given that this president has praised torch-wielding white folks who chanted “Jews will not replace us!” as “very fine people,” is an upside-down piece of dishonest hypocrisy.Oh, the Republicans say, I don’t like all the things Trump says, but I stand behind the president.As if there’s daylight between “being racist” and “supporting a racist.” If you believe that, get ready to spend your days in darkness.This week was a breaking point for America’s soul, and we got a good picture of who is standing on which side of the divide. The Republican Party is with the racist president — all in.And the Americans at the racist president’s rally Wednesday night? They’re even more all in. So much so that they’ve lost sight of what this country is all about.Nothing about the four congresswomen Trump has targeted makes them un-American. Nothing they’ve said suggests they hate America.But angrily chanting “Send her back!” while the president of the United States stands there and soaks it in? That shows a certain kind of hate.Will those Trump supporters admit to being racist? Maybe a few, but not many.I have to ask: You clearly don’t mind expressing your point of view, so why not just accept the title? Why not embrace it? If you feel so strongly about an issue that you’ll stand up with thousands of others and chant something hateful, why not wear the label like a badge of honor?Here’s a place where Trump could show real leadership. Admit it, Mr. President. Tell the world what it already knows. Say the words, “I am a racist.”He won’t. Neither will the Republicans who support him, nor the crowds at his rallies.Cowards, every one.But they’re Americans, just like me. Just like Ilhan Omar. Just like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. And they have a right to believe what they want to believe and say what they want to say.I’m not going to call for them to be kicked out of the country, no matter how much I detest what they’re saying.That not how things work here.That’s something I would expect the president of the United States to know. And not stand by like a coward as that ideal gets stomped to dust.rhuppke@chicagotribune.com


On Wednesday, President Donald Trump held a 2020 campaign rally in North Carolina that saw supporters chanting the words "send her back" after the U.S. leader renewed his racist attacks on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. The owner of a restaurant in that city has now revealed he will be donating 100 percent of the proceeds made that day to efforts to support immigrantsIn a Facebook post ahead of Trump's rally, Matthew Scully, who owns The Scullery restaurant in Greenville, shared a photo of a sign placed in his restaurant's window announcing that "100% of today's sales will be donated to [the] American Immigration Council in order to help with the immigration crisis at our southern border and to celebrate our diverse community.""I had already been thinking about the president and especially about his comments over the past couple of days and it's just sort of difficult to wrap your head around it," Scully told Newsweek.  "It brought up negativity and division in our community...and that's just kind of hard to sit and watch," he said. "So, we just thought this would be an opportunity to spread a positive message."Scully could not have known when he posted the sign in his restaurant's window, however, that Trump would escalate his attacks on Omar, as well as fellow progressive Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, who the U.S. leader had tweeted on Sunday should "go back" to the "crime-infested places from which they came."The U.S. leader took further aim at the four congresswomen, who are all women of color, during the rally, calling them "hate-filled extremists." He then railed against Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia when she was just eight years old, as the crowd of supporters chanted "send her back, send her back."U.S. lawmakers and critics from around the world have condemned both Trump and his supporters over the racism displayed at the rally, with writer and activist Shaun King branding it "one of the single most racist moments in modern American political history."Scully said he was "very disappointed" knowing that residents of his own community had been present at the rally, potentially taking part in the racist "send her back" chant."You know, especially with the racism that's in the media right now and the chants at the rally last night, it's just really embarrassing for my community, telling people to 'go back where they came from'," he said. "It just makes me sad and offended."The restaurant owner, a father of three, said it also upset him to think of the migrant children being detained at the border."I have little kids and thinking about the kids at the border and the trauma they're going through... I just hate that for them... and thinking about the future and how they can shake that kind of trauma and get on with a successful life. It's just hard to imagine," he said.Scully said that the sign in his window attracted hundreds of customers to his restaurant throughout the day on Wednesday, with The Scullery serving as many as 500 people and making more than $5,800 in sales, all of which will be donated to the American Immigration Council.On its website, the American Immigration Council describes its mission as being to "strengthen America by shaping how America thinks about and acts towards immigrants and immigration and by working toward a more fair and just immigration system that opens its doors to those in need of protection and unleashes the energy and skills that immigrants bring."It further states that it works to bring together "problem solvers and employs four coordinated approaches to advance change—litigation, research, legislative and administrative advocacy, and communications.""With this synergy, the Council works to advance positive public attitudes and create a more welcoming America—one that provides a fair process for immigrants and adopts immigration laws and policies that take into account the needs of the U.S. economy," the council states.On Facebook, many social media users praised Scully and his restaurant for supporting the immigrant community, with one customer writing: "Love this!!! So glad I chose to have breakfast there today! This is what America is about.""Very Proud that the Scullery is a part of my neighborhood and community," another said. "Thank so much for all you do to help and give back. Greenville N.C. is lucky to have you, and we sure do love you!"Of course, there were some critics, Scully acknowledged, with one apparent Trump supporter writing: "MAGA!!! Thanks for the heads up! If you really cared, you would donate to local homeless shelter or veterans. Now watch your business plummet!"However, the majority of the feedback appeared to be positive, with old customers promising to return and new customers vowing to pay a visit to the Scullery."We received lots of great comments and phone calls and then maybe two or three negative phone calls," he said. Overall, Scully said, "it's been extremely positive."© 2019 Newsweek

The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economiesIn-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diasporaLifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economyManagement news, advice, and ideas for business leadersCreate, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroomIn between stints as US attorney general for George HW Bush in the early 90s and now for Donald Trump, while making millions as an executive at Verizon and a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis, William Barr sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to various Republicans and their causes.Most of those donations made between 1993 and 2019 were occasional at best. But in the lead up to his Senate confirmation hearings for attorney general earlier this year, his giving habits suddenly changed. Barr’s donations became far more frequent, notable for their size, recipients, and possible utility to him. In total, Barr gave $51,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC)—a group that raises money to help elect Republicans to the Senate—in the months leading up to the Senate’s confirmation of his nomination.Barr’s ramped up contributions took place over a 5-month period from October 2018 to February 2019 and were substantially different than his prior giving to the NRSC, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings. In the past Barr gave sporadically, once in 2009 and 2011, twice in 2014, one contribution in 2015, and another in 2016. Then, Jeff Sessions’ tenure as attorney general got rocky, and Barr started giving regularly. He donated on a schedule, providing $10,000 every month to the NRSC, on the third of the month, starting in October. That continued until he was confirmed on Feb. 14, 2019, just 11 days after his last contribution.Neither Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, nor Eric Holder—the three prior attorneys general—made payments to either party committees or senators ahead of confirmation hearings and votes. Holder gave $250 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2007—two years ahead of his confirmation, and also made a contribution to then California senator Barbara Boxer in 2008. Lynch gave $13,800 to Barack Obama’s election efforts in 2008. She wasn’t nominated to become attorney general until 2014.Quartz contacted the Department of Justice for comment from the attorney general on the contributions but has not yet received a response. This story will be updated if the DOJ replies to the query.The donations do not violate FEC rules. The contributions should, however, “raise eyebrows,” says Adav Noti, a senior director at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington DC, a campaign finance watchdog.“The fact that any one person can give such large amounts to a political party creates a perception problem,” Noti—who was formerly associate general counsel at the FEC— explained. “Someone giving such large amounts to a senatorial committee before their confirmation certainly raises appearance questions.”The obvious question raised by these donations is whether they were intended to influence a particular outcome. “Maybe it’s a coincidence. Maybe not,” Noti says of the timing and sums. But as long as there was no implicit or explicit quid pro quo, no exchange for an official act—and there is no evidence here that Barr expected or was promised anything in exchange for his donations—there is no legal issue with the contributions. Still, Noti said it is “a flaw in the system” that such large and targeted contributions are permitted.Barr himself has opined on the matter of prosecutors contributing to political campaigns. In 2017, he spoke to the Washington Post about the prosecutors former special counsel Robert Mueller was hiring as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the US election and the president’s efforts to thwart that investigation, some of whom had contributed to Democratic causes. “In my view, prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party,” Barr said.His own donations are similarly suspect, although the NRSC refunded $30,000 to Barr on Feb. 6, about a week before he was confirmed (Quartz has contacted the NRSC for comment and will update the story with a response). The contributions also indicate that Barr wasn’t quite as reluctant to serve under Trump as has been previously reported. In June, the New York Times wrote that “by all accounts, Mr. Barr was not anxious to join Mr. Trump’s team,” and noted that he declined an earlier opportunity to represent Trump as his private criminal counsel, saying, “I didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder.”However, Barr did in 2018 send an unsolicited 20-page memo to then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein regarding Mueller’s investigation, titled “Mueller’s ‘obstruction’ theory.” In it, he wrote, “the Constitution vests all Federal law enforcement power, and hence prosecutorial discretion, in the President.” (Emphasis in the original). Barr stated that there can be “no limit on the President’s authority to act on matters which concern him or his own conduct.” In other words, he wasn’t lying low hoping to go unnoticed but signaling strongly that he would defend Trump.Indeed, as attorney general, Barr has played a key role in supporting the president. When the Mueller report was completed in March, Barr issued a misleading statement indicating that it cleared the president of obstruction of justice allegations. But when the full 448-page report was released in April, it showed only that Mueller felt constrained by a rule that barred him from charging the president. Mueller actually outlined in the report 11 situations in which Trump tried to thwart his team’s work. The attorney general held a press conference before releasing the full report that again minimized any wrongdoing on the president’s part and spoke of his “non-corrupt motives,” which stood in stark contrast to Mueller’s extensive findings. Barr wasn’t entirely forthright and he seemed to be speaking as if he was the president’s personal defense attorney rather than the nation’s chief prosecutor.In May, testifying before the Senate about the report, he explained his position, which further illuminated Barr’s view on executive power. “The president does not have to sit there constitutionally and allow [the investigation] to run its course. The president could terminate the proceeding and it would not be a corrupt intent because he was being falsely accused.” Later that same month, Trump authorized Barr to investigate the investigators, and look for “crimes” the president claims were committed by “the other side” when examining his own activities.It’s become apparent that serving as attorney general under Trump, who shares Barr’s expansive notions of executive power, allows Barr to pursue what his former DOJ colleague Donald Ayer called “his life’s work of creating an all-powerful president.”According to the New York Times, “Trump’s advisers saw him as the perfect replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions when the president forced him out in November: someone with Republican establishment gravitas and distinguished legal pedigree who seemed to share at least some of the president’s views.”He was reportedly recommended for the role by Abbe D. Lowell, the criminal defense lawyer representing Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka, among others. Based on the stark increase in Senate Republican donations ahead of his confirmation, Barr was anything but indifferent to the recommendation or the prospect of becoming attorney general again, this time under a like-minded president.Update: This story was updated to reflect the fact that the NRSC refunded $30,000 in contributions to Barr about one week before his confirmation.

	The US president is making his most overt attempt yet to mobilise votes using deep white supremacism. Get the New Statesman's Morning Call email.
	Fascism is coming to America. Not simply out of an underground movement of far-right fantasists but from the US presidency. That’s the only rational conclusion we can draw from last night’s Trump rally in North Carolina. And I don't care how much this affronts your preconception of what fascism is. 

	During a three-minute tirade against the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, in which Trump delivered a series of smears, the crowd was triggered to chant “Send her back!” — a chant taken up by the hand-picked white women standing behind Trump for the camera shot. Omar was born in Mogadishu but has been an American citizen since 2000. She is among the 40 million US citizens, 14 per cent of the population, who are first generation immigrants. 

	After Trump unleashed a series of overtly racist tweets against four left-wing Democratic congresswomen, this is always where it was going to end. The narrative that the left is alien to American culture, that politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should “go back” to the places from which their families migrated, was a clear and premeditated attempt to mobilise votes using deep white supremacism.
	In one sense, like all Trump’s outrages, the use of deportation rhetoric against US citizens of colour is rhetorical. Omar and Ocasio-Cortez cannot legally be “sent back” anywhere. Like the chants calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed, the outburst serves the purpose of vocalising the illegal and irrational fantasies of reactionary voters.

	But Trump’s new strategy is far more than rhetoric. There are millions of Americans who can legally be “sent back” — being either undocumented migrants or the children of people whose migration status is unclear. 

	Omar and Ocasio-Cortez, along with Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, chose bravely to politicise the inhuman treatment of refugees and migrants in Trump’s border camps. Trump’s response raises the subtextual threat that when settled, entirely legal communities of non-white Americans show solidarity with people caged like animals, and children separated from their parents, they too can be otherised.

	If you listen to Trump’s tirade, delivered in Greenville last night, the entire structure of the argument is borrowed from Hitlerism. He starts with the “radical left” — they are “extremists”, opposed to the US constitution “who reject everything our nation stands for”. Then he moves to Omar, who, in a series of misquotes, he portrays as a supporter of America’s enemies. He throws in the unfounded accusation of anti-Semitism. And the crowd delivers the punch line.

	We know where this leads because we have Nazi Germany as the textbook. Ocasio-Cortez, controversially for some, called Trump’s detention camps “concentration camps”. But the racialisation of German political discourse, followed by the racialisation of law, led to Kristallnacht and the Shoah. 

	Like all Trump rallies, Greenville was a classic display of what Hannah Arendt called “the temporary alliance of the elite and the mob”. What they want, just as in Germany in the 1930s, is to reverse history: to reverse the globalisation of the world economy, reverse the rise of a multi-ethnic and multilingual society, and reverse laws guaranteeing human and equal rights for people of colour.
	It is interesting to note what really triggered the crowd: not a left-wing protester being dragged away. This merely caused them to chant “USA” — as if being anti-Trump is to be unpatriotic. No, what really triggered them was when Trump told them Omar “looks down with contempt on hard-working Americans saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country”. 

	Let’s be clear. The people at Trump rallies are not stupid. But they are demonstrating a calculated ignorance. This is a movement against climate science, against vaccines, against professional expertise and against culture. One of the biggest indicators that you are going to vote for Trump is not poverty: it is the belief that getting a college degree is useless.
	If you want to know how and why sections of the business elite switched so easily from paying lip service to liberalism to shovelling money into the Trump project, the answer is depressingly clear. They are terrified of even the most basic redistribution of wealth and power that would happen if a government came to power that was not in the pockets of banks, property speculators and the Saudi monarchy.

	They are prepared to deploy racism because — in America as here in the UK — it has proven the sure-fire way of mobilising a middle class whose incomes are sliding, and whose economic security has been uncertain since 2008.

	An elite prepared to deploy racism is not new. But an elite prepared to comply with the politicisation of the judiciary, overt nepotism and the racialisation of politics is a step change. An elite prepared to deal out doses of hatred by teleprompter, against politicians who in all other eras would be vaunted as role models and success stories. This is the beginning of fascism.

	It means the 2020 presidential election will, even if won by the Democrats, create a mass, plebeian movement, sanctified by an incumbent president, which identifies the left, feminists and people of colour as alien to the nation. The 2020s will be dominated by white America’s “stab in the back” myth. And from the ashes of the Trump presidency, something truly nasty will emerge.

	Everybody who does not fight this now is complicit in the crimes that will follow.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Thursday said he didn't think President Donald Trump's tweets directed at four progressive Democratic Congresswomen of color were racist—an about-face from previous comments he'd made about the president, including the time in 2015 when Graham called Trump "a race-bating" bigot.Graham defended Trump's tweets from Sunday stating that "'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen'" — referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley — should "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came" and that they "can't leave fast enough."The South Carolina senator's reasoning for claiming that the president's tweet wasn't racist was that Trump only wanted his opponents to go away, not all people of color."I don't think it's racist to say," Graham told reporters. "I don't think a Somali refugee embracing Trump would be asked to go back. If you're racist, you want everybody to go back because they are black or Muslim. That's not what this is about. What this is about to me is that these four congresswoman, in their own way, have been incredibly provocative."Graham concluded: "If you think he's a racist, that's up to you—I don't."The senator's flip led historian and author Kevin Kruse to share a video compilation posted by writer Dusty Giebel highlighting Graham's change of heart.Graham's "If you think he's a racist, that's up to you—I don't" remark from today is followed by a clip of him from 2015 saying "he's a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.""He doesn't represent my party," Graham continues about Trump the year before he won the presidency. "He doesn't represent the values that the men and women who are wearing the uniform are fighting for."And here's the video of both, plus more. Lindsey contains multitudes.https://t.co/x0QngP6dlkThe video, which Giebel titled "Lindsey Graham vs Lindsey Graham," includes more contradicting statements overtime by the senator."I'm not gonna try to get into the mind of Donald Trump because I don't think there's a whole lot of space there. I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office," Graham says in a clip from the past.That remark is followed by a more recent comment from Graham: "You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as some kind of kook, not fit to be president."Graham has denounced Trump's seemingly racist views in more instances than the ones featured in the video.In 2016 when Trump was running for president, Graham denounced the candidate for calling a federal judge born in the U.S. "a Mexican" and accusing the judge of being biased against him and his plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico."The most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy," Graham said at the time, adding that if any supporters were "looking for an off ramp, this is probably it."Graham, who turned from harsh Trump critic to frequent supporter of the president, on Monday went on Trump's favorite show Fox & Friends to bash "The Squad" of four women lawmakers."We all know that [Ocasio-Cortez] and this crowd are a bunch of communists," Graham said. "They hate Israel, they hate our own country, they're calling the guards along our border—the Border Patrol agents—concentration camp guards."© 2019 Newsweek


 Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said President Donald Trump was a "racist" and "fascist" a day after he falsely accused her of supporting Al Qaeda and looked on as the crowd at a rally in North Carolina  chanted "send her back." "I believe he is fascist," Omar told reporters on Thursday.  The Minnesota lawmaker, who is a naturalized US citizen, said America is "supposed to be a country where we allow democratic debate and dissent to take place."  "This is not about me — this is about us fighting for what this country truly should be," she added.  The "send her back" chant echoed the president's racist tweets on Sunday suggesting that Omar and three other progressive Democratic congresswomen of color — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib — "go back" and "help fix the totally broken and crime infested" countries "from which they came."  All four are US citizens, and three were born in the US. Omar was born in Somalia and came to the US as a child after fleeing a civil war. She became a US citizen at 17.                                                                                                                             Read more: Weeks of Democratic infighting between Nancy Pelosi and 'the Squad' preceded Trump's racist tweet attacks The president did not object to the chant at the time and paused to let it continue for about 13 seconds.  "She looks down with contempt on the hardworking Americans, saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country," Trump said of Omar before the chant.  On Thursday, he told reporters he was "not happy" and disagreed with the chant.  The "send her back" chant — and the fact Trump did not rebuke it as it transpired — prompted widespread criticism of the president and his reelection campaign.                                                                                                                              But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, defended the president on Thursday, saying he didn't think chant was racist because it wouldn't have been said about a Somali refugee who embraced Trump. Read more: Trump supporters chant 'send her back' as the president attacks Ilhan Omar at rally in North Carolina "I don't think a Somali refugee embracing Trump would not have been asked to go back. If you're a racist, you want everybody from Somalia to go back because they're black or they're Muslim,"  Graham said. "That's not what this is about to me. What this is about to me is that these four congresswomen, in their own way, have been incredibly provocative."  The "go back" comments reference a racist "go back to Africa" trope leveled for generations against black people who spoke up against injustice and unfair working conditions.                                                                                                                              Omar also told reporters on Thursday that Graham defended Trump's comments "by saying that if I was wearing a MAGA hat, if there was a Somali person wearing a MAGA hat, they would not be deported, but because I criticized the president I should be deported." 


Press Play, Get SmarterReporterRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Thursday told reporters she believes President Trump is “fascist,” and said his supporters are against the foundations of American democracy. “We have said this president is racist. We have condemned his racist remarks. I believe he is fascist,” Omar said in response to Trump’s attacks on four female lawmakers of color. “I want to remind people that this is what this president and his supporters have turned this country, this is supposed to be a country where we allow democratic debate and dissent to take place. And so, this is not about me. This is about us fighting for what this country truly should be[.]” In recent days, Trump faced intense backlash after he tweeted that Omar—along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI)—should go back to their countries. Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, and Tlaib are from the United States, while Omar became a citizen in 2000. At a Wednesday night rally, Trump’s supporters doubled down against Omar and chanted that Trump should “send her back.”

    Opinions on reparations differ among those whose relatives were slaves and slave owners in Mitch McConnell's Alabama boyhood home.
    Nashville TennesseanKentucky Democrats will have more options on next year's ballot when deciding who should take on Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in 2020.Farmer and retired Marine Mike Broihier (pronounced Broy-er), a first-time candidate, entered the race Thursday with a three-minute advertisement that calls on voters to forget their labels.“It's time to retire Mitch McConnell," Broihier said in an interview with the Courier Journal this week. "We have to do it to restore our democracy, and I've been warned about what he's capable of doing, but it doesn't scare me."The spot features a diverse group of Kentuckians holding tiny chalkboards with different slurs and descriptions, such as "baby killer" and "hillbilly" and "queer."Democratic Senate candidate Mike Broiher (Photo: The Broiher campaign)"Labels are powerful things," Broihier says in the ad. "For 35 years, Mitch McConnell has used labels to reinforce old prejudices, divide us, to maintain his grip on power."Related: KSR's Matt Jones yanked from TV show amid US Senate speculationBroihier, 57, is a Wisconsin native who moved to the Bluegrass State in 2005 after he and his wife, Lynn, also a retired Marine officer, bought a 75-acre farm in Lincoln County. He said the two have raised grass-fed beef, pastured poultry, pigs and sheep on their farm.Since living in Kentucky, he has worked as a reporter and editor for The Interior Journal, a small town newspaper which is the third-oldest such publication in the state.Broihier said being a rural journalist, farmer and military veteran gives him a unique perspective and qualification to run."I've been doing this in Kentucky for 15 years, and I really think it's a part of me," he said. "I think I've got a heck of a lot more in common with the people in Kentucky maybe than McConnell ever had."Broihier is the third Democrat to have officially entered the primary contest, which could be one of the more watched races in 2020.Health care professional Steve Cox, of Madisonville, entered the race in May but has made little noise since then.Amy McGrath vs. Mitch McConnell: 5 things to know about the 2020 Senate raceFormer Marine Amy McGrath, who has gained the most national attention, has been in the race since last week. She is the presumed frontrunner in the race given her support from party leaders and various major groups such as VoteVets.McGrath has already raked in more than $5 million, but she stumbled in the first days of her race after saying she would have voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Those missteps have spawned concern among many progressive voters and Democratic officials, such as Rep. John Yarmuth, who say that there should be a contested primary election next year.Other Democrats who are thinking about running include sports radio host Matt Jones, state Rep. Charles Booker, of Louisville, and House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, of Sandy Hook.Broihier discussed the status of the race, meeting with McGrath and his views on various issues in a one-on-one interview with the Courier Journal this week. Here are highlights of that conversation.CJ: How would you describe Amy McGrath's debut, and did it give you the inspiration to run?Broihier: We have a connection through the Marine Corps, and I got her personal email and said, "Hey, we've met before and I supported you in your congressional race." We met and talked for about two hours. She was the first person I told I was interested in running.CJ: Were you troubled by her rollout at all and the messaging about President Trump and her flip on Justice Brett Kavanaugh?Broihier: The Kavanaugh thing was inexplicable to me. She found Christine Blasey Ford to be a credible witness, but yeah she would have voted for Kavanaugh. That was troubling. At the core of what troubles me is I don't recognize her from the candidate she was just a year ago.Yarmuth: Amy McGrath's early errors show a primary challenge 'might be helpful'CJ: I'm guessing you wouldn't have voted for Judge Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court?Broihier: No. If you accept the fact that Ford was credible, then how could you? I stopped right there. On its face that was disqualifying.CJ: Are you worried about a contentious Democratic primary?Broihier: I don't know if it has to be contentious ... but there has to be a primary. CJ: What distinguishes you in this race from your opponents?Broihier: If I had an elevator pitch, I'd ask them what's on their mind before they go to bed or put their kids on the school bus. And if they said, "what are they going to do for me" I would say champion economic justice, because Kentucky is being left behind from Appalachia to the Mississippi, we are being left behind.CJ: What does economic justice mean?Broihier: I don't want to make it sound like it's everything to every person, but let's break it down. I talked to a woman named Lauren — she was concerned about why men and women aren't paid the same. She said, "what more do women have to do?" And I said it's up to policymakers to enforce the rules. Another young man reminded me for him it was about redlining, because where he lives he can't get a small business loan or a mortgage on a new house.CJ: Do you support medical marijuana, recreational marijuana or both?Broihier: Both. Take a look at what's happening in Colorado. It's not a big state with a lot of people, but they cleared another $250 million in taxes last year. While it would have to scale in a place like Kentucky, it would go a long way. You regulate it and you tax it.CJ: Have you ever smoked marijuana?Broihier: Yes ... much younger.CJ: Should there be any restriction or regulation on a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy?Broihier: I think there's probably a time in the development from embryo to fetus, I think it's around 21 weeks, beyond which there is absolutely and positively must be exceptions made. There cannot be a hard-and-fast rule that says if you make it past this day you are going to carry this baby to term. Whether it's the situation surrounding the conception, such as rape, and re-traumatize her all over again or the health of the mother or viability of the fetus. This was settled five decades ago correctly under Roe v. Wade.CJ: Should Congress have a role in these mass shootings that catch the nation's attention but also the day-to-day gun violence?Broihier: I live in the country at the end of a quarter-mile-long driveway. All of my neighbors have guns, farmers have guns and everyone I know pretty much in Kentucky has guns. Every single one of them supports universal background checks. I believe 84% of NRA members support background checks.CJ: Then why is it so difficult to get through Congress?Broihier: Because the Senate majority leader doesn't want to move it. I don't know if the thought of dead children keeps Mitch McConnell up at night, but he doesn't want to do it because he's beholden to the gun manufacturers. People in Kentucky pride themselves on common sense, and they would not be averse to common sense restrictions. It is a right to keep and bear arms, but with rights comes a lot of responsibilities. There are things most people agree upon: instant background checks, restrictions on devices and modifications that make semi-automatic weapons and make it fire like an automatic weapons. The single point of failure resides in the Senate majority leader.Read this: Kentucky's new concealed carry law: Here's what you should knowCJ: Who did you vote for in 2016 for president?Broihier: I voted for Hillary Clinton.CJ: Clinton lost Kentucky by 30 percentage points. You're clearly in the minority, and you want to represent this state?Broihier: Well, I'll tell you who was popular here who was my primary choice: Bernie Sanders. People here in Kentucky were, I think, looking for somebody different ... I voted for Hillary Clinton because she won in the primary and she absolutely, positively wasn't Donald Trump.CJ: Is there someone in the 2020 Democratic primary you're leaning toward?Broihier: I like Mayor Pete. I like the way he talks, he's got so much experience ... I used to be a little turned off when Elizabeth Warren speaks, but I've got to say I don't know whether I've changed or she's changed, but when she gets going she is passionate and so smart. What I see in her now is she's letting it all hang out. Kamala Harris is also interesting.CJ: Is President Trump a racist?Broihier: Either it's just grotesque race-baiting or he's a racist. It is one or the other and both of them are horrific. He is throwing this rancid meat at his, I think, very, very small base. I don't think we're talking about your average Kentuckian who voted for him, I think we're talking about his whatever it is, 17% of the hardest of the hardcore. Whether in his heart of hearts, I can't look into his heart whether he's a racist or grotesque race-baiting but either one is horrible and bad for America.Sen.

In Britain, it is Diane Abbott (and in a strange way: Meghan Markle). In Brazil, it would have been Marielle Franco – but she was killed last yearIn light of Donald Trump’s hate-filled rally yesterday, a Zimbabwean proverb –  “if you can talk, you can sing. If you can walk, you can dance” may have to be updated to include: “If you can openly chant white supremacist slogans at a presidential rally, you can openly practice white supremacy.”The footage was eerily reminiscent of a Klan rally. The near universally white crowd, goaded and exploited by a demagogue posing as a leader or father figure, chanted, “Send her back! Send her back!” as Donald Trump, president of the United States of America, poured scorn over US congresswoman Ilhan Omar. This is not an isolated occurrence. There is precious little racist movements (both “mild” and extreme, as well as implicit and explicit) find more infuriating than outspoken, intelligent and powerful women of colour. The Trump movement is no different in this regard. And Ilhan Omar is not alone. From

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.In many nations where white supremacy (sometimes politely referred to as “populism”) is on the rise, there tends to be one constant: an Ilhan Omar. A woman of colour the nation can rally around to vilify, mock, pour scorn on and, horrifyingly, sometimes even worse. In Italy, it is Cécile Kyenge. In Britain, it is Diane Abbott (and in a strange way: Meghan Markle). In France, it is Christiane Taubira. In Brazil, it would have been Marielle Franco – but she was killed while giving a speech last year. Two former policemen have since been charged with her murder.These are clearly not isolated occurrences. They are key indicators of rising fascism. This extreme public “othering” of people, especially minority ethnic women, is a persistent hallmark of modern white supremacist movements.Though slightly more polite than “N***** go home”, the chant “Send her back” serves the exact same purpose. Such chants make it abundantly clear that you – ungrateful ethnic that you are – should humble yourself and be a little more thankful for being here. It should be noted that the mother of “Send her back”, the cesspool from which it emerged, is decades of alarmingly racist and anti-immigrant normalised narratives and media coverage. Non-white people – myself included – are all very familiar with the slogans, chants and nationalist catchphrases Omar is being subjected to: “Go home”, “If you don’t like it here, leave”, “You should be grateful to live here”, “F*** off back to bongo-bongo land”. They all make one thing abundantly clear: fascism is coming out of the closet. Again. As we say in the black community: I don’t know who needs to hear this, but here goes. The post-First World War fascist movements history mostly warns of were defined by populist leaders who presented themselves as victims and used false news, demagoguery, nationalism, patriotism – including slogans and chants – to promote their cause. Chillingly, the fact that Donald Trump is such a mega fan of rallies should come as no surprise.The fact that the British foreign secretary and potential next leader of the nation could not call out Donald Trump’s racism – which he demurely labelled “the R-word” –  the fact that he could not call out the normalising of explicit white supremacy shows how ill-equipped we are to fight such ideas today.  The days when it was shameful to be a racist or a white supremacist are fading away very swiftly. And the days where racism or white supremacy was politely labelled “populism” must also fade away as a result. If racists are to be proud to wear the badge of racism, as Steve Bannon advised the Front National, then they should be made to wear it. Rhetoric leads to racial hatred. Racial hatred leads to violence. Violence leads to greater violence.And the lessons of the past show us that what ends in almost unimaginable barbarity can begin with simple single-syllable words: “Send her back.” Fascist lunacy easily spirals out of control. Hence we must all remember that it is fantastically easier and preferable to confront and curtail rhetoric than it is to confront and curtail violence. Nels Abbey is a writer based in London.

Drew Magary on the president and the triumph of fear.I have spent the past three years slogging under the assumption that the entire Trump storyline would culminate in some kind of massive, public cataclysm: nukes going off, assassinations, World War III getting under way, etc. Such potential calamities still loom perilously on the horizon. But in the meantime, the horrors of what is being conducted here in America have come in steady waves: Puerto Rico being left for dead, state-sanctioned human rights abuses at the border, law enforcement officials joining online hate groups, tanks on the National Mall, more mass shootings, the president being openly racist and staging hate rallies, and on and on it goes. I would tell you Trump is gonna get someone killed, but he has already fulfilled that prophecy. The catastrophe is already here, and it is growing.And yet, there is no urgency. All I got is a formal condemnation of a few tweets, and the House couldn't even pull that off without making an embarrassing spectacle of it. A cursory impeachment proposal from Congressman Al Green was easily voted down by a majority of Democrats. And there's obvious symbolism to be found in Trump getting more hateful and frenzied the night an effort to oust him was tabled indefinitely. I am like millions of other suckers who put all their eggs into Robert Mueller’s basket and hoped his work would initiate President Trump’s downfall (Mueller, ever the polite fellow, seemed to encourage this initiation but erred for subtlety when blunt force was so, so necessary), but that never happened. The men beholden to Trump made certain of it, and complacent leadership from Democrats has only served to further enable the opposition.Two weeks ago, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did her now infamous sitdown with perennial vicious circle wannabe Maureen Dowd, in which Dowd called impeachment a “primal pleasure” and Pelosi explained that Trump “practically self-impeaches” in his daily transgressions, but that actually impeaching him (or at least trying to) would play right into his hands. She also told the Washington Post that trying to remove Trump from office is “just not worth it.” Hence, no serious impeachment proposal is in the offing.Pelosi is hardly alone among Democrats in avoiding this battle, because so many of them judge impeachment to be a losing one, one that might come back to bite them in the ass in 2020. Every time a Democrat does something halfway wise, smarmy news analysts are like, "Oooh, the GOP'll use that against them for sure!" And so Democrats are skittish about even attempting such partial measures. When they do get around to executing them, they do so as tepidly as possible.Former Congressional stalwart Barney Frank just gave an impassioned defense of Pelosi to Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker, and it was a cogent defense but enervating in the ways Frank sides with Pelosi is believing Democrats should only take what the defense gives them. This is a constant long game Democrats play, where they assume that sitting tight and giving Republicans enough rope to hang themselves will result in triumph at the ballot box somewhere down the road. That’s victory enough for them, apparently. Pelosi was somewhat validated when this strategy paid dividends this past November and Democrats reclaimed the House. But rather than take that restored power and act as a forceful check on the president, party leaders have elected to again hold back, offer the occasional tut-tut, and place their bets on future elections that could already be prematurely compromised by gerrymandering that has cut off crowded blue areas of the electoral map from the corridors of power, by foreign interference, by the spread of mass disinformation, and by a judiciary now predisposed to strike down any election result it doesn’t care for, or any law that has even a whiff of compassion to it.Meanwhile, the shit keeps rolling downhill. On the surface of things, I suppose you could be prudent and wait for a white knight 2020 Dem to come riding in on horseback to save the country 16 months from now. On the other hand, where is the URGENCY? Why am I sitting here waiting for leaders to do something meaningful only to find out that so many of them are themselves content on hoping for things to magically improve LATER?It will be extra terrible if we treat impeachment as some reckless crime of passion instead of the proper action to take against a flagrantly lawless administration.Believing you can only so much right now is an excuse that Americans like me are tired of hearing. A lot will happen between now and November 2020, and a lot of it will be terrible, just as the past three years have been. And it will be extra terrible if we treat impeachment as some reckless crime of passion instead of the proper action to take against a flagrantly lawless administration. By letting this continue to fester, Democratic leaders are encouraging social complacency. I, being a cosseted suburbanite, walk outside and things are normal, at least in the superficial sense. The street lights work. Local ATMs are still operational. It is not hailing meteorites. And so it’s very easy to be sheltered like me and come to treat what is happening right now as The Way Things Just Are. Doing next to nothing to rid the country of Trump right now, this instant, only helps cement his corruption as an expected, and acceptable, machination of our Federal government. The greater media has little issue going along with this, telling you to pay no mind to that mind behind the curtain. And Democrats seem all too determined to cultivate unity the only way they know how, i.e. via surrender.What you are witnessing is the triumph of fear. Trump rode to the presidency by stoking fears among his base of immigrant bogeymen and of liberal swamp roamers and all that other horseshit. He has governed with that fear, and he has, in turn, made the opposition far, far too afraid: of him, of displeasing his disproportionately influential voter base, of levying any tangible punishment upon Trump that might incite violence from a sector of Americans who clearly have a taste for it, of upsetting racists (and we are now at the point where the right wing has successfully managed to make “racist” its own unspeakable epithet), and of FIGHTING: of doing the hard work that is clearly needed to stop us from falling into a fucking black hole.This is where I remind you that Donald Trump is afraid of stairs. There is no more cowardly a pig in this country, and indulging him in his bravado by not initiating formal action against him only encourages more sniveling pigs to come sidling up to the trough. Fatten them up and they only get harder to move out of the way. Impeachment is only a lost cause if you view it in the most fatalistic terms, and if you’re afraid that doing the right thing right now will somehow make you look irrational and weak. It will not. Now matters. It has to, and a lot of people get this. There is no more long game to play. Setting impeachment in motion is not a careless act, nor is it a suicide mission. Quite the contrary: It is a long overdue step in trying to derail a suicide mission we’ve already all been forced to slowly embark upon.Since 1957, GQ has inspired men to look sharper and live smarter with its unparalleled coverage of style, culture, and beyond.

Court documents related to hush money payments arranged by President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen were filed unsealed Thursday.The documents include a description of an Oct. 8, 2016, phone call Cohen received from Trump’s campaign communications chief Hope Hicks, during which 'Trump joined the call,' which federal investigators believed was related to an effort to keep porn star Stormy Daniels from going public with her claims of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.Hicks was interviewed by the FBI about the phone calls with Cohen, the documents indicate.The filing by federal prosecutors in New York came a day after the judge in Cohen’s criminal case ordered their release, saying that the end of a probe into those payments meant they should be made public.as much as i hate trump and the republicansTHIS CHANGES NOTHING !!! the day he either leaves or gets removed from office is the day i will change my toneDidn’t Cohen already tell us about some of those in his interview thing? Pretty sure he talked about at least one of them.Here we go again Reddit!Corruption. Pure corruption.Gasp! (Nothing will happen)Wrong. We’re taking him down,Trump will live in infamyI'm all out of pretend-to-be-shocked juice.Holy shit. They're reporting he would've been indicted if not for DOJ policy.Electing Trump as president may be the second most heinous act in American history next to slavery.Naw, I'm sure electing the descendant of Africans to president was far more harmfulAlso, you know, the whole slaughtering millions of natives and shipping the survivors off to the shittiest bits of real estate thing, too.Nowhere close tbh. Lets start the scale with slavery, move on down to massacres like wounded knee, then onto imperialist wars like vietnam, then cia dark ops destabilization under operation condor, then maybe trump.He isn't some new thing  America has been a racist hateful and violent country through it's entire history.Probably a dumb question but, Cohen is in jail for crimes related to this topic and Trump is an indicted co-conspirator who hasn’t been indicted because of the DoJ memo. Assuming nothing else comes of this legally. After Trump leaves office can he still go to jail for the crimes he’d be indicted for now?Most likely.  Another half of this, though, is that the statute of limitations on campaign finance violations is five years from the date of violation.  Theoretically, that statute of limitations should be tolled if there's any merit to the idea that you can't indict a sitting president.  But what if (heaven forbid) Trump gets re-elected, arrested after his second term, and argues that the statute of limitations has passed?  At that point, he could freely argue that a sitting president could be indicted, but the DOJ just refused to do so.“People” will shout dems are jailing political opponents and get ‘em guns out.That’s assuming he leaves office. As Cohen himself told us, we should expect that he will refuse to leave, precisely because leaving exposes him to consequences for his lifetime of crimes.Anybody going to mention that these documents were unsealed because the SDNY closed their case? No?That’s incorrect. Bill Barr, whom misrepresented the findings in the Mueller Report closed down the investigation.Closed one case. What about the other 11?This just in.

				President Donald Trump pauses as he speaks at a campaign rally at Williams Arena in Greenville, North Carolina.			
				Carolyn Kaster/AP/Shutterstock			It felt like President Trump’s rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday night was probably going to be an ugly one. It was grotesque. The East Carolina University arena was pulsing with white nationalist synergy through the president’s time on stage, provided a horrifying glimpse of what the next 16 months are going to look like.And, perhaps more hauntingly, what they’re going to sound like.As expected, Trump continued his attacks on Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), the four congresswomen of color the president has spent the week demonizing as un-American after they made comments critical of his administration’s immigration policy. When Trump mentioned Omar, his liberal bogeyman du jour, the audience began chanting “SEND HER BACK!,” a chilling successor to the “LOCK HER UP!” chants directed at Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 campaign and beyond. This time, the call is not merely to jail a political opponent, but to forcefully expel an American citizen from the country.	Plenty have howled about how damaging politically it was for Trump to tweet on Sunday that Omar and her colleagues should “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” The same people warned of the consequences of Trump’s countless racist provocations as he geared up for his first run at the White House. He kept it up then, and it shouldn’t be surprising not only that he has double, triple, and quadrupled down on his recent attacks against the congresswomen, but that he appears poised to turn the issue into the beating heart of his 2020 campaign.Crowd at tonight's Trump rally in North Carolina breaks out into chants of "Send her back!" as the president attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/0q5L39W61h— Jon Passantino (@passantino) July 17, 2019Xenophobia is Trump’s gin card, and by virtue of tuning in to watch Fox News rail against Omar and her colleagues on Sunday morning, he’s stumbled into a fresh way to play it ahead of 2020. Though some public-facing conservatives have bristled at his comments (and many others have excused them or supported them), Trump knew his base would have his back. “It doesn’t concern me because many people agree with me,” Trump said on Monday when asked if he was worried about his attacks energizing white nationalists.“SEND HER BACK!” was the resounding confirmation, and Wednesday night’s event in Greenville isn’t likely to be the last time thousands of the president’s supporters chant it in unison.Similar to how it responded to his tweets on Sunday, the media excoriated Trump for talking about Mexican rapists flowing over the border when he announced his campaign in the summer of 2015. He took the attention as a sign to keep hammering the point, upping the ante whenever necessary. Build a wall? Build a wall! What about a Muslim ban? Why not! He soon found himself at the top of the polls, and, ultimately, in the White House. There’s no reason why Trump wouldn’t run it back again for 2020.	The polls say it’s unpopular; political scientists and pundits warn it’s bad politics. But they said all that in 2016, and like a trained dog, Trump will keep hitting the racism button harder and harder and keep expecting treats.He’s certainly not done with Omar, either. One of the first Muslim women elected to Congress is too convenient of a vessel into which he and his supporters can pour their prejudices. Trump is treating her like a new toy, citing her “hatred” of “Jews” (a right-wing delusion), her praise of al-Qaeda (which never happened), and her disagreement with his immigration policy (to be expected from a Democrat in Congress) as the reasons she should probably just get go ahead and get the hell out of the United States. The real reason, of course, is that Omar is a powerful women with brown skin and a hijab, and Trump and Fox News find that so threatening and jarring that they’ve conjured these absurd narratives they feel justify their bigotry.Omar responded Wednesday night with a stanza from Maya Angelo’s poem “Still I Rise.”You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I’ll rise.-Maya Angelou https://t.co/46jcXSXF0B— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) July 18, 2019A few hours later, Omar tweeted a picture of herself standing at the podium in the House of Representatives. “I am where I belong, at the people’s house,” she wrote, “and you’re just gonna have to deal!”***UPDATE: President Trump on Thursday tried to distance himself from the chant. “I was not happy with it, I disagree with it,” he told reporters at the White House.This post has been updated.

				Carolyn Kaster/AP/Shutterstock			It felt like President Trump’s rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday night was probably going to be an ugly one. It was grotesque. The East Carolina University arena was pulsing with white nationalist synergy through the president’s time on stage, provided a horrifying glimpse of what the next 16 months are going to look like.And, perhaps more hauntingly, what they’re going to sound like.As expected, Trump continued his attacks on Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), the four congresswomen of color the president has spent the week demonizing as un-American after they made comments critical of his administration’s immigration policy. When Trump mentioned Omar, his liberal bogeyman du jour, the audience began chanting “SEND HER BACK!,” a chilling successor to the “LOCK HER UP!” chants directed at Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 campaign and beyond. This time, the call is not merely to jail a political opponent, but to forcefully expel an American citizen from the country.	Plenty have howled about how damaging politically it was for Trump to tweet on Sunday that Omar and her colleagues should “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” The same people warned of the consequences of Trump’s countless racist provocations as he geared up for his first run at the White House. He kept it up then, and it shouldn’t be surprising not only that he has double, triple, and quadrupled down on his recent attacks against the congresswomen, but that he appears poised to turn the issue into the beating heart of his 2020 campaign.Crowd at tonight's Trump rally in North Carolina breaks out into chants of "Send her back!" as the president attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/0q5L39W61h— Jon Passantino (@passantino) July 17, 2019Xenophobia is Trump’s gin card, and by virtue of tuning in to watch Fox News rail against Omar and her colleagues on Sunday morning, he’s stumbled into a fresh way to play it ahead of 2020. Though some public-facing conservatives have bristled at his comments (and many others have excused them or supported them), Trump knew his base would have his back. “It doesn’t concern me because many people agree with me,” Trump said on Monday when asked if he was worried about his attacks energizing white nationalists.“SEND HER BACK!” was the resounding confirmation, and Wednesday night’s event in Greenville isn’t likely to be the last time thousands of the president’s supporters chant it in unison.Similar to how it responded to his tweets on Sunday, the media excoriated Trump for talking about Mexican rapists flowing over the border when he announced his campaign in the summer of 2015. He took the attention as a sign to keep hammering the point, upping the ante whenever necessary. Build a wall? Build a wall! What about a Muslim ban? Why not! He soon found himself at the top of the polls, and, ultimately, in the White House. There’s no reason why Trump wouldn’t run it back again for 2020.	The polls say it’s unpopular; political scientists and pundits warn it’s bad politics. But they said all that in 2016, and like a trained dog, Trump will keep hitting the racism button harder and harder and keep expecting treats.He’s certainly not done with Omar, either. One of the first Muslim women elected to Congress is too convenient of a vessel into which he and his supporters can pour their prejudices. Trump is treating her like a new toy, citing her “hatred” of “Jews” (a right-wing delusion), her praise of al-Qaeda (which never happened), and her disagreement with his immigration policy (to be expected from a Democrat in Congress) as the reasons she should probably just get go ahead and get the hell out of the United States. The real reason, of course, is that Omar is a powerful women with brown skin and a hijab, and Trump and Fox News find that so threatening and jarring that they’ve conjured these absurd narratives they feel justify their bigotry.Omar responded Wednesday night with a stanza from Maya Angelo’s poem “Still I Rise.”You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I’ll rise.-Maya Angelou https://t.co/46jcXSXF0B— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) July 18, 2019A few hours later, Omar tweeted a picture of herself standing at the podium in the House of Representatives. “I am where I belong, at the people’s house,” she wrote, “and you’re just gonna have to deal!”***UPDATE: President Trump on Thursday tried to distance himself from the chant. “I was not happy with it, I disagree with it,” he told reporters at the White House.This post has been updated.

Court documents related to hush money payments arranged by President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen were filed unsealed Thursday.The documents include a description of an Oct. 8, 2016, phone call Cohen received from Trump’s campaign communications chief Hope Hicks, during which 'Trump joined the call,' which federal investigators believed was related to an effort to keep porn star Stormy Daniels from going public with her claims of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.Hicks was interviewed by the FBI about the phone calls with Cohen, the documents indicate.The filing by federal prosecutors in New York came a day after the judge in Cohen’s criminal case ordered their release, saying that the end of a probe into those payments meant they should be made public.as much as i hate trump and the republicansTHIS CHANGES NOTHING !!! the day he either leaves or gets removed from office is the day i will change my toneDidn’t Cohen already tell us about some of those in his interview thing? Pretty sure he talked about at least one of them.Here we go again Reddit!Corruption. Pure corruption.Gasp! (Nothing will happen)Wrong. We’re taking him down,Trump will live in infamyI'm all out of pretend-to-be-shocked juice.Holy shit. They're reporting he would've been indicted if not for DOJ policy.Electing Trump as president may be the second most heinous act in American history next to slavery.Naw, I'm sure electing the descendant of Africans to president was far more harmfulAlso, you know, the whole slaughtering millions of natives and shipping the survivors off to the shittiest bits of real estate thing, too.Nowhere close tbh. Lets start the scale with slavery, move on down to massacres like wounded knee, then onto imperialist wars like vietnam, then cia dark ops destabilization under operation condor, then maybe trump.He isn't some new thing  America has been a racist hateful and violent country through it's entire history.Probably a dumb question but, Cohen is in jail for crimes related to this topic and Trump is an indicted co-conspirator who hasn’t been indicted because of the DoJ memo. Assuming nothing else comes of this legally. After Trump leaves office can he still go to jail for the crimes he’d be indicted for now?Most likely.  Another half of this, though, is that the statute of limitations on campaign finance violations is five years from the date of violation.  Theoretically, that statute of limitations should be tolled if there's any merit to the idea that you can't indict a sitting president.  But what if (heaven forbid) Trump gets re-elected, arrested after his second term, and argues that the statute of limitations has passed?  At that point, he could freely argue that a sitting president could be indicted, but the DOJ just refused to do so.“People” will shout dems are jailing political opponents and get ‘em guns out.That’s assuming he leaves office. As Cohen himself told us, we should expect that he will refuse to leave, precisely because leaving exposes him to consequences for his lifetime of crimes.Anybody going to mention that these documents were unsealed because the SDNY closed their case? No?That’s incorrect. Bill Barr, whom misrepresented the findings in the Mueller Report closed down the investigation.Closed one case. What about the other 11?This just in. Water is in fact wetYes it’s illegal on multiple fronts. I’ll let someone more knowledgeable explain it.@AndrewLSeidelLISTEN TO THIS EPISODE. It's not about whether Trump signed. @patorrezlaw: "This is about Donald Trump, 1.5 weeks before the election, having his lawyer form an illegal LLC to pay hush money to a witness with a knowledge of multiple crimes and that's impeachable."https://openargs.com/oa154-stormy-daniels-is-a-legal-genius/Michael Cohen went to prison for it, so yes, absolutely.Ask Cohen, he's in prison for it. Not like you care.To anyone trying to say, "both sides" or "You wouldn't care if it was Dem..." Then read this highlighting how Democrats stay consistent while Republicans are blindly loyal and hold double-standards for their party.It's at this moment I'd like to remind people that conservatives diversify their news less and are less educated overall than the left.Anyone who says that is a Republican shill with no empathy or morality for fellow humans.5.3mMembers51.3kOnline/r/Politics is for news and discussion about U.S. politics.

NEW YORK — Multimillionaire and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will remain jailed while he awaits trial on new allegations that he sexually abused children, a federal judge ruled Thursday. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman announced the decision at a hearing, siding with prosecutors after they and defense attorneys traded arguments for more than a week about whether Epstein could be released to some sort of home confinement.The judge later issued a 33-page written decision, saying he was “concerned for new victims” and that Epstein’s sexual conduct with young girls “appears likely to be uncontrollable.”Berman pointed to nearly every piece of evidence prosecutors had cited in their bid to keep Epstein locked up, deeming Epstein both a serious danger to the community and a significant flight risk.He referred to evidence that Epstein had missed required sex offender check-ins and to “sexually explicit photos” investigators recovered at Epstein’s home after his arrest. The judge noted investigators had seized from a safe in Epstein’s home $70,000 in cash, loose diamonds and an expired foreign passport with Epstein’s picture but someone else’s name.And he called “compelling” the testimony of two women who allege Epstein abused them as children. Annie Farmer and Courtney Wild had this week urged the judge to keep Epstein locked up.“The Government’s evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong,” Berman wrote.At the same time, Berman deemed “inadequate” the defense’s offer to have Epstein placed in home confinement — even with several other conditions. He said Epstein’s attorneys had not given him specific enough information about Epstein’s financial assets but seemed to suggest more data or more assurances might not have swayed his decision.“I doubt that any bail package can overcome danger to the community,” Berman said in court.[‘He was inappropriate with me’: Epstein face to face with accusers at bail hearing]Epstein, 66, was arrested July 6 after landing at New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport and charged with sex trafficking dozens of girls from 2002 to 2005. The case drew significant attention because in 2008, the jet-setting financier was able to resolve similar allegations by pleading guilty to just two state charges. He spent about 13 months in jail, with work release privileges, as part of the agreement.The deal, which has been criticized as overly lenient, was approved by Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney in Miami whom President Trump picked as his labor secretary. Acosta resigned from the Labor Department post after the new charges were brought, drawing more attention to his handling of the previous case.Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the new charges, which his attorneys have asserted are effectively an improper do-over of the old case. If Epstein had been granted bail, defense attorneys said, he would have been willing to put up his $77 million Manhattan mansion as collateral and agree to home confinement with 24/7 security that he would have funded.Sigrid McCawley, an attorney for some who allege Epstein abused them, said she was “thrilled” by Berman’s decision.“Only by taking away the freedom of Jeffrey Epstein can we restore the freedom of these victims,” she said. “They have been living in fear and intimidation since the day they were abused by him, and now he is in jail.”Prosecutors argued that no set of restrictions would guarantee Epstein would keep showing up for court. By their telling, Epstein is an impenitent sexual abuser of children who in the past has sought to obstruct inquiries into his misdeeds and has virtually limitless means to escape justice.[Epstein paid suspected co-conspirators, which prosecutors suggest may have been to ‘influence’ them]Epstein, who financial records show is worth more than $500 million, is a frequent world traveler with access to two private jets, prosecutors said.They pointed to the expired passport as evidence that Epstein “knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities.” And there is evidence that someone used it: Prosecutors said in a court filing Wednesday that the document “contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.”Epstein’s attorneys wrote in a court filing Tuesday that the passport, from Austria, expired 32 years ago and asserted it was for Epstein’s safety.They asserted that “Epstein — an affluent member of the Jewish faith — acquired the passport in the 1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel.”“The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnappers, hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur,” they wrote.On Thursday, Epstein’s defense team wrote that he “never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration or customs authority.” The stamps, they wrote, predated when Epstein received the document and “do not reflect Mr. Epstein’s entries or exits.”They dismissed concerns about his foreign travel, asserting that even as many were “clamoring for his re-prosecution” after news reports on his 2008 deal, he traveled extensively and “invariably returned to the United States.”Epstein will be held in the federal detention center in Manhattan.

 Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  One of the most chilling things about President Trump’s hate-rally in North Carolina — which devolved into chants of “send her back,” directed at a nonwhite immigrant member of Congress — was the profusion of tweets about it from abroad.Robert Mann, the historian of the civil rights era, lamented from across the Atlantic that it’s “shocking” to be in Britain while “one of the top stories” all over the British media is “just how much of a vile racist my country has for a president.”Tweeting from Australia, the New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb noted that in Sydney, “many people” have asked him about Trump’s “latest bigotry spree.” Cobb added: “this is a reminder that the entire world is an audience for this abject racist stupidity.”As the president of the United States leads a domestic hate movement, the world is watching.In case you think this is too American-centric a view, Cobb pushed back on that, as well. “Believe it or not,” he noted, “if you have the world’s largest economy, people pay close attention to you.”The world will be watching this spectacle for at least the next 16 months: New reporting is now confirming that Trump views his racist and white-nationalist provocations as key to his reelection effort.“These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,” Trump ranted at his North Carolina rally on Wednesday night. “They want to demolish our Constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country.”Trump, of course, was referring to the four lawmakers he has attacked for days on end — all members of racial, ethnic or religious minority groups — at one point suggesting they “go back” to their countries, even though three were born in the United States.The “go back” language is apparently resonating deeply with Trump supporters. When Trump singled out Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the only one who wasn’t born in the United States, the crowd erupted in a blood-curdling chant of “send her back."Trump’s mention of Omar drew loud, sustained boos. Trump mangled Omar’s words to dishonestly paint her as an al-Qaeda sympathizer, and his tone dripped with contempt as he lingered over his pronunciation of Omar’s last name. This produced more scattered, angry catcalls.When Trump repeated that the “hate-filled extremists” should “leave,” the cheering grew deafening. It’s important to reiterate here that Trump is talking about duly elected members of Congress and singling out those who are members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities as targets of his call to “leave.”In other words, they are not members in good standing of the American nation. These are well-worn white-nationalist tropes, a contemporary iteration of this country’s long history of illiberal racial nationalism. These are what the crowd cheered.Racist tropes are central to Trump’s campaignTrump views energizing his base around such tropes as central to his reelection. The Associated Press reports that Trump and his campaign believe that placing “racial polarization at the center of his call to voters” carries “far more benefits than risks.”We know what Trump is doing here. The reporting has established a pattern, in which Trump’s racist provocations are employed deliberately to foment racism, rage and/or hate among his supporters. Trump’s belief that his base would cheer was partly what drove his attacks on African American athletes and his refusal to condemn white-supremacist violence.Not all of Trump’s advisers are so sure this will work in 2020. According to the New York Times, some believe “divisive cultural clashes” are risky.

NEW YORK — Multimillionaire and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will remain jailed while he awaits trial on new allegations that he sexually abused children, a federal judge ruled Thursday. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman announced the decision at a hearing, siding with prosecutors after they and defense attorneys traded arguments for more than a week about whether Epstein could be released to some sort of home confinement.The judge later issued a 33-page written decision, saying he was “concerned for new victims” and that Epstein’s sexual conduct with young girls “appears likely to be uncontrollable.”Berman pointed to nearly every piece of evidence prosecutors had cited in their bid to keep Epstein locked up, deeming Epstein both a serious danger to the community and a significant flight risk.He referred to evidence that Epstein had missed required sex offender check-ins and to “sexually explicit photos” investigators recovered at Epstein’s home after his arrest. The judge noted investigators had seized from a safe in Epstein’s home $70,000 in cash, loose diamonds and an expired foreign passport with Epstein’s picture but someone else’s name.And he called “compelling” the testimony of two women who allege Epstein abused them as children. Annie Farmer and Courtney Wild had this week urged the judge to keep Epstein locked up.“The Government’s evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong,” Berman wrote.At the same time, Berman deemed “inadequate” the defense’s offer to have Epstein placed in home confinement — even with several other conditions. He said Epstein’s attorneys had not given him specific enough information about Epstein’s financial assets but seemed to suggest more data or more assurances might not have swayed his decision.“I doubt that any bail package can overcome danger to the community,” Berman said in court.[‘He was inappropriate with me’: Epstein face to face with accusers at bail hearing]Epstein, 66, was arrested July 6 after landing at New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport and charged with sex trafficking dozens of girls from 2002 to 2005. The case drew significant attention because in 2008, the jet-setting financier was able to resolve similar allegations by pleading guilty to just two state charges. He spent about 13 months in jail, with work release privileges, as part of the agreement.The deal, which has been criticized as overly lenient, was approved by Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney in Miami whom President Trump picked as his labor secretary. Acosta resigned from the Labor Department post after the new charges were brought, drawing more attention to his handling of the previous case.Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the new charges, which his attorneys have asserted are effectively an improper do-over of the old case. If Epstein had been granted bail, defense attorneys said, he would have been willing to put up his $77 million Manhattan mansion as collateral and agree to home confinement with 24/7 security that he would have funded.Sigrid McCawley, an attorney for some who allege Epstein abused them, said she was “thrilled” by Berman’s decision.“Only by taking away the freedom of Jeffrey Epstein can we restore the freedom of these victims,” she said. “They have been living in fear and intimidation since the day they were abused by him, and now he is in jail.”Prosecutors argued that no set of restrictions would guarantee Epstein would keep showing up for court. By their telling, Epstein is an impenitent sexual abuser of children who in the past has sought to obstruct inquiries into his misdeeds and has virtually limitless means to escape justice.[Epstein paid suspected co-conspirators, which prosecutors suggest may have been to ‘influence’ them]Epstein, who financial records show is worth more than $500 million, is a frequent world traveler with access to two private jets, prosecutors said.They pointed to the expired passport as evidence that Epstein “knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities.” And there is evidence that someone used it: Prosecutors said in a court filing Wednesday that the document “contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.”Epstein’s attorneys wrote in a court filing Tuesday that the passport, from Austria, expired 32 years ago and asserted it was for Epstein’s safety.They asserted that “Epstein — an affluent member of the Jewish faith — acquired the passport in the 1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel.”“The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnappers, hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur,” they wrote.On Thursday, Epstein’s defense team wrote that he “never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration or customs authority.” The stamps, they wrote, predated when Epstein received the document and “do not reflect Mr. Epstein’s entries or exits.”They dismissed concerns about his foreign travel, asserting that even as many were “clamoring for his re-prosecution” after news reports on his 2008 deal, he traveled extensively and “invariably returned to the United States.”Epstein will be held in the federal detention center in Manhattan.

 Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  One of the most chilling things about President Trump’s hate-rally in North Carolina — which devolved into chants of “send her back,” directed at a nonwhite immigrant member of Congress — was the profusion of tweets about it from abroad.Robert Mann, the historian of the civil rights era, lamented from across the Atlantic that it’s “shocking” to be in Britain while “one of the top stories” all over the British media is “just how much of a vile racist my country has for a president.”Tweeting from Australia, the New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb noted that in Sydney, “many people” have asked him about Trump’s “latest bigotry spree.” Cobb added: “this is a reminder that the entire world is an audience for this abject racist stupidity.”As the president of the United States leads a domestic hate movement, the world is watching.In case you think this is too American-centric a view, Cobb pushed back on that, as well. “Believe it or not,” he noted, “if you have the world’s largest economy, people pay close attention to you.”The world will be watching this spectacle for at least the next 16 months: New reporting is now confirming that Trump views his racist and white-nationalist provocations as key to his reelection effort.“These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,” Trump ranted at his North Carolina rally on Wednesday night. “They want to demolish our Constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country.”Trump, of course, was referring to the four lawmakers he has attacked for days on end — all members of racial, ethnic or religious minority groups — at one point suggesting they “go back” to their countries, even though three were born in the United States.The “go back” language is apparently resonating deeply with Trump supporters. When Trump singled out Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the only one who wasn’t born in the United States, the crowd erupted in a blood-curdling chant of “send her back."Trump’s mention of Omar drew loud, sustained boos. Trump mangled Omar’s words to dishonestly paint her as an al-Qaeda sympathizer, and his tone dripped with contempt as he lingered over his pronunciation of Omar’s last name. This produced more scattered, angry catcalls.When Trump repeated that the “hate-filled extremists” should “leave,” the cheering grew deafening. It’s important to reiterate here that Trump is talking about duly elected members of Congress and singling out those who are members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities as targets of his call to “leave.”In other words, they are not members in good standing of the American nation. These are well-worn white-nationalist tropes, a contemporary iteration of this country’s long history of illiberal racial nationalism. These are what the crowd cheered.Racist tropes are central to Trump’s campaignTrump views energizing his base around such tropes as central to his reelection. The Associated Press reports that Trump and his campaign believe that placing “racial polarization at the center of his call to voters” carries “far more benefits than risks.”We know what Trump is doing here. The reporting has established a pattern, in which Trump’s racist provocations are employed deliberately to foment racism, rage and/or hate among his supporters. Trump’s belief that his base would cheer was partly what drove his attacks on African American athletes and his refusal to condemn white-supremacist violence.Not all of Trump’s advisers are so sure this will work in 2020. According to the New York Times, some believe “divisive cultural clashes” are risky.

 Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  One of the most chilling things about President Trump’s hate-rally in North Carolina — which devolved into chants of “send her back,” directed at a nonwhite immigrant member of Congress — was the profusion of tweets about it from abroad.Robert Mann, the historian of the civil rights era, lamented from across the Atlantic that it’s “shocking” to be in Britain while “one of the top stories” all over the British media is “just how much of a vile racist my country has for a president.”Tweeting from Australia, the New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb noted that in Sydney, “many people” have asked him about Trump’s “latest bigotry spree.” Cobb added: “this is a reminder that the entire world is an audience for this abject racist stupidity.”As the president of the United States leads a domestic hate movement, the world is watching.In case you think this is too American-centric a view, Cobb pushed back on that, as well. “Believe it or not,” he noted, “if you have the world’s largest economy, people pay close attention to you.”The world will be watching this spectacle for at least the next 16 months: New reporting is now confirming that Trump views his racist and white-nationalist provocations as key to his reelection effort.“These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,” Trump ranted at his North Carolina rally on Wednesday night. “They want to demolish our Constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country.”Trump, of course, was referring to the four lawmakers he has attacked for days on end — all members of racial, ethnic or religious minority groups — at one point suggesting they “go back” to their countries, even though three were born in the United States.The “go back” language is apparently resonating deeply with Trump supporters. When Trump singled out Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the only one who wasn’t born in the United States, the crowd erupted in a blood-curdling chant of “send her back."Trump’s mention of Omar drew loud, sustained boos. Trump mangled Omar’s words to dishonestly paint her as an al-Qaeda sympathizer, and his tone dripped with contempt as he lingered over his pronunciation of Omar’s last name. This produced more scattered, angry catcalls.When Trump repeated that the “hate-filled extremists” should “leave,” the cheering grew deafening. It’s important to reiterate here that Trump is talking about duly elected members of Congress and singling out those who are members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities as targets of his call to “leave.”In other words, they are not members in good standing of the American nation. These are well-worn white-nationalist tropes, a contemporary iteration of this country’s long history of illiberal racial nationalism. These are what the crowd cheered.Racist tropes are central to Trump’s campaignTrump views energizing his base around such tropes as central to his reelection. The Associated Press reports that Trump and his campaign believe that placing “racial polarization at the center of his call to voters” carries “far more benefits than risks.”We know what Trump is doing here. The reporting has established a pattern, in which Trump’s racist provocations are employed deliberately to foment racism, rage and/or hate among his supporters. Trump’s belief that his base would cheer was partly what drove his attacks on African American athletes and his refusal to condemn white-supremacist violence.Not all of Trump’s advisers are so sure this will work in 2020.

Jeffrey EpsteinA legal document expected to be released within days is likely to reveal allegations of sexual abuse by “numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders” with ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Vanity Fair reported Wednesday.The document will be unveiled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which is hearing a defamation case brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers, against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime friend.“It’s going to be staggering, the amount of names,” a source with litigation against Epstein told Vanity Fair. “It’s going to be contagion numbers.”The article notes that Epstein was able to maintain relations with high-powered figures long after he registered as a sex offender in 2008, including a dinner in Silicon Valley a few years ago where he met Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk (Zuckerberg said their meeting was only in passing and they never met again; Musk says he on one occasion went to Epstein’s house but declined his repeated invitations to visit his private island).Other powerful friends of Epstein include President Trump, former president Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.Epstein, who was charged this month with sex trafficking, was denied bail on Thursday.During the raid on his New York house last week, police discovered a passport that included a false name. In a legal filing Thursday, Epstein’s attorney said that the fake passport was never used, but was given to him by a friend because “some Jewish-Americans were informally advised at the time to carry identification with a non-Jewish name while traveling internationally in case of hijacking.”Aiden Pink is the deputy news editor of the Forward.

					By Nathaniel RakichFiled under 2020 Senate ElectionsPHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGESA month and a half ago, the pollster Critical Insights released a poll that said Republican Sen. Susan Collins’s approval rating had dropped to 41 percent and her disapproval rating had risen to 42 percent. But it was just one poll, and others found that she still enjoyed strong support.However, Morning Consult’s quarterly poll of senators’ approval ratings, released on Wednesday night, agrees that Collins’s popularity is underwater. Only 45 percent of Mainers said they approved of her compared with 48 percent who said they disapproved, and only one senator (Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) has a higher disapproval rating than Collins now does.This is a stark turnaround for Collins, who was once one of the most popular senators in the country. In the first quarter of 2017, for instance, Morning Consult gave her a +40 net approval rating (her approval rating of 67 percent minus her disapproval rating of 27 percent). But her reputation for bipartisanship took a hit last fall, when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee who faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Granted, her popularity was already on the decline before that vote (she had a +22 net approval rating in the second quarter of 2018), and it didn’t nose-dive immediately after it (it was still +15 in the fourth quarter of 2018), but importantly, it does seem to have polarized her support along party lines.Before the vote, Morning Consult found Collins enjoyed the approval of most Democrats and independents, while Republicans were split 47-47 on her job performance. But after the vote, her net approval among Republicans surged, while it dropped with independents and plummeted among Democrats. In the latest poll, her net approval rating was +27 among Republicans, -2 among independents and -40 among Democrats.That’s a bad trade for Collins, because Maine is a Democratic-leaning state (it has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean1 of D+5), so she will need the support of some independent and/or Democratic voters to win reelection in 2020. With these latest numbers from Morning Consult, Collins has a Popularity Above Replacement Senator score of +2 — in other words, she is just 2 points more popular than we’d expect a generic Republican to be in Maine. Just three months ago, her PARS score was +18. That personal popularity was supposed to go a long way toward helping her get reelected against the partisan tide. But now her popularity simply falls along party lines, just like it does for fellow vulnerable Republican Sens. Cory Gardner (a +1 PARS), Joni Ernst (-1) and Martha McSally (-6), who are also up for reelection in 2020. With the decline of split-ticket voting for races at the top of the ballot, that could mean Collins is in real jeopardy of losing if the Democratic presidential nominee wins Maine in 2020.And unlike her 2008 and 2014 reelection campaigns, Collins was already facing a tough race in 2020. In the aftermath of her vote on Kavanaugh, progressive groups collectively have raised $4.7 million for her eventual Democratic opponent. And in recent weeks, multiple Democrats announced they would run for her seat, most prominently state House Speaker Sara Gideon, who was quickly endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and raised $1.1 million in her first week. Together with this poll, these latest developments in the race support the idea that Collins may turn out to be of the most vulnerable senators up in 2020.FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a state votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Note that the partisan leans in this article were calculated before the 2018 elections; we haven’t calculated FiveThirtyEight partisan leans that incorporate the midterm results yet.Nathaniel Rakich is FiveThirtyEight’s elections analyst.   @baseballotFiled underApproval Ratings (100 posts)

EWING — A police officer has been charged with murdering his three-month-old daughter, who died in December six days after she was admitted to the hospital with a fractured skull and ribs.Daniel Bannister, 31, was suspended from the force in December, although authorities did not explain why until the murder charge was announced Wednesday. He was arrested Wednesday morning at a Wawa on Silvia Street.His wife, Catherine Bannister, 29, was charged Wednesday with second-degree child endangerment.Before Hailey Rose died, the family set up a GoFundMe page that said that the baby had suffered a "catastrophic brain injury." The campaign raised $17,618 for funeral expenses and medical bills.An autopsy in December determined that Hailey Rose died from complications from blunt impact trauma of the head including skull fractures and brain bleeding."The nature of Hailey’s injuries indicated an ongoing pattern of abuse," Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo Onofri said Wednesday.Police were notified about the "suspicious nature of Hailey’s injuries" after the family made a 911 call on Dec. 5 to report an unresponsive baby that was not breathing.Catherine Bannister placed the call and told 911 dispatchers: "My husband is an officer, so he’s working with her right now, but we need help," according to a copy of the 911 call obtained by The Trentonian.EMTs said Hailey Rose was suffering from a heart attack and took her to Capital Health Medical Center-Hopewell, where she was listed in critical condition with a fractured skull, brain bleed and multiple fractured ribs. She was then taken to Robert Wood Johnson Children’s Hospital in New Brunswick, where she died on Dec. 11.In February, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor told New Jersey 101.5 that Bannister had been suspended with pay but would not say whether the suspension was related to the death of the baby.Prosecutors on Wednesday did not provide other details about the case, including how exactly the baby suffered the injuries or why it took investigators seven months to file charges.New Jersey 101.5 did not know Wednesday whether the Bannisters had attorneys who could speak on their behalf.Bannister had been a police officer since 2017. The couple also has a son.Sergio Bichao is deputy digital editor at New Jersey 101.5. Send him news tips: Call 609-359-5348 or email sergio.bichao@townsquaremedia.com. 


 Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  This post has been updated.After an outcry over the “send her back!” chants directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) at his rally Wednesday night — including criticism from some Republicans — President Trump declared Thursday that he didn’t like them, either.“I was not happy with it; I disagree with it," he said. Asked why he didn’t stop the chant, Trump said, "I think I did. I started speaking very quickly.”This is complete nonsense. And there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical he really disliked it or that it will cease.First off, contrary to Trump’s claim, he actually paused to absorb the chants, as you can see in the video above (courtesy of J.M. Rieger). And then he waited a full 13 seconds — literally until the chants stopped.After that, he kept right on talking about Omar, rather than changing the subject. Even if you don’t expect Trump to instantaneously rebuke his supporters — like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) famously did when a woman called Barack Obama an “Arab” at a 2008 town hall — you’d think Trump would move on from the topic if he didn’t like the response.Secondly, Trump seems to have been aiming for this, starting with his tweets Sunday urging Omar and three other minority congresswomen to “go back” to their countries. He hasn’t technically told them to leave — instead saying “why don’t they” and telling them that if they don’t like the United States, they can leave — but his meaning has been clear. And Wednesday night was part of a completely predictable progression. You don’t talk about immigrants going back to where they came from unless you’re at least toying with the ugly history of that sentiment.And the third point is that we’ve been here before. The “send her back!” chants brought to mind the “lock her up!” chants from Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies. And then, just as today, Trump initially claimed that he didn’t like the chants.Here’s what he told the press on July 27, 2016:When I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before started screaming, “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up.” They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.And I said, “Don’t do that.” Now, I didn’t do that for any reason. I really — I didn’t like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said — they started screaming “Lock her up! Lock her up.” I said, “Don’t do that.”Trump then repeated his claim, while including a provocative addendum, “I think it’s a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.”In a rally just two days later, though, Trump cited Hillary Clinton’s alleged lies about him and said he was done being so “nice” about such things. At later rallies, the chants continued to pop up, and he did nothing to stop them. Then, in an early October debate, he hit back at Clinton by saying that if he was president, “you’d be in jail.” By Oct. 14, he explicitly embraced the phrase, responding to the chants by saying, “For what she’s done, they should lock her up — they should.”And then, as president, Trump set about trying to make the chants a reality.Given all of that, it’s difficult to accept what he said Thursday at face value -- even if he had told the truth about what transpired.

He hasn’t technically told them to leave — instead saying “why don’t they” and telling them that if they don’t like the United States, they can leave — but his meaning has been clear. And Wednesday night was part of a completely predictable progression. You don’t talk about immigrants going back to where they came from unless you’re at least toying with the ugly history of that sentiment.And the third point is that we’ve been here before. The “send her back!” chants brought to mind the “lock her up!” chants from Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies. And then, just as today, Trump initially claimed that he didn’t like the chants.Here’s what he told the press on July 27, 2016:When I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before started screaming, “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up.” They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.And I said, “Don’t do that.” Now, I didn’t do that for any reason. I really — I didn’t like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said — they started screaming “Lock her up! Lock her up.” I said, “Don’t do that.”Trump then repeated his claim, while including a provocative addendum, “I think it’s a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.”In a rally just two days later, though, Trump cited Hillary Clinton’s alleged lies about him and said he was done being so “nice” about such things. At later rallies, the chants continued to pop up, and he did nothing to stop them. Then, in an early October debate, he hit back at Clinton by saying that if he was president, “you’d be in jail.” By Oct. 14, he explicitly embraced the phrase, responding to the chants by saying, “For what she’s done, they should lock her up — they should.”And then, as president, Trump set about trying to make the chants a reality.Given all of that, it’s difficult to accept what he said Thursday at face value -- even if he had told the truth about what transpired.

Former White House communications director and former press secretary for the Trump campaign Hope Hicks was one a number of individuals highlighted Thursday morning in the Southern District of New York, where search warrants related to ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s campaign finance violations were unsealed. According to the documents, Hicks was one of multiple individuals in the loop regarding alleged affairs with then-candidate Trump ahead of the 2016 election. People are now wondering if there is a congressional perjury referral in her future.I’m going to be surprised if there isn’t a 1001 violation referral for Hope Hicks by the end of tomorrow. It appears rather clear she lied to Congress about the Stormy Daniels saga.— Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) July 18, 2019The “1001 violation” mentioned above is a reference to 18 USC § 1001, which makes “any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation” a federal crime. This is what the statute says:(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully—
(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;
(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or
(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.If this statute seems familiar, that’s probably because former special counsel Robert Mueller busted multiple people for it, including Cohen.The Cohen warrants showed that the FBI investigator reviewed telephone records and came to the conclusion that Donald Trump, Cohen and Hicks were all on the same phone call. What was this call about? Per the agent: “Based on the timing of these calls, and the content of the text messages and emails, I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford [Stormy Daniels] from going public, particularly in the wake of the Access Hollywood story.”On October 8, 2016, the agent wrote, Cohen got a call from Hicks and Trump joined the call 16 seconds later. The call is said to have gone on for four minutes.A footnote went into further detail about why the agent believed this was a three-party call that also included Trump.“I believe that Trump joined the call between Cohen and Hicks based on my review of toll records. Specifically, I know that a call was initiated between Cohen’s telephone number at the same time the records indicate that Cohen was talking to Hicks. After the Cohen-Trump call was initiated, it lasted the same period of time as the Cohen-Hicks call,” the agent said. “In addition, based on my conversations with an FBI agent who has interviewed Hicks, I have learned that Hicks stated, in substance, that to the best of her recollection, she did not learn about the allegations made by Clifford until early November 2016. Hicks was not specifically asked about this three-way call.”Indeed, in early November–days before the election–Hicks was aware of an imminent storm, namely the Wall Street Journal reporting about the National Enquirer catching-and-killing former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s claim that she had an affair with Trump.Cohen was pleased at the time that the story wasn’t getting a lot of traction and Hicks replied the she saw a similar lack of traction. “Same. Keep praying!! It’s working!”As a result of all of this, Hicks’ June 19 interview before the House Judiciary Committee is now being scrutinized more closely. During it, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) asked Hicks directly if she was “ever present when Trump and Cohen discussed Stormy Daniels?”Hicks replied, “No, ma’am.” Rep. Jackson Lee repeated the question and Hicks again said “No.”White House lawyer Patrick Philbin interjected on behalf of Hicks to clarify if the questioning was “limited to during [the] campaign.” The three-way phone call is said to have happened in October (during the campaign), and the FBI agent surmised that call included discussion about Stormy Daniels.Rep. Jackson Lee continued, asking, “So do you know what they would say?”Hicks reiterated that she was “never present for a conversation.”There was no further information in the warrants about what was discussed during that three-party phone call Hicks is said to have joined.National security lawyer Bradley P. Moss told Law&Crime that while false statement charges are “rarely ever open and shut cases,” the search warrant evidence “raises the distinct and likely possibility that Hicks misled Congress in her testimony.”“It all comes down to context and actual direct evidence, as opposed to circumstantial evidence that requires degrees of inference. At a minimum, the evidence outlined in the search warrant raises the distinct and likely possibility that Hicks misled Congress in her testimony,” Moss told Law&Crime. “It also reflects a situation in which an indictment would certainly be viable: whether the government would prevail at trial is difficult to say for certain without more information.”BREAKING: Ex-Trump campaign aide Hope Hicks will not be charged, nor will anyone else, in relation to investigation in Southern District of New York, sources tell @ABC News. https://t.co/VJBrk2HPIM— Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) July 18, 2019While Hicks is out of the woods in terms of the SDNY investigation of campaign finance violations, it’s not clear if that is also true in terms of her congressional testimony.[Image via Olivier Douliery-Pool and Getty Images]Matt Naham is managing editor of Law&Crime.

Toys R Us, in...President Donald Trump said Thursday that a U.S. Navy ship had destroyed an Iranian drone in a  "defensive action," escalating already high tensions in the oil-rich Gulf region.The USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, took down the drone in the Strait of Hormuz earlier Thursday, Trump said.The Boxer is part of a group of Navy ships that was in the strait, located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, as part of an increased U.S. military presence in the region.Twenty percent of the world's crude oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz.The incident came four weeks after Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone flying over international airspace the same area, in what American officials at the time called an  "unprovoked attack."And it came hours after Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized a foreign tanker it accused of smuggling oil.During an event at the White House, Trump said,  "The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone, which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew." "The drone was immediately destroyed," Trump said.The president called the drone's approach toward the Boxer  "the latest of many provocative and hostile actions against vessels operating in international waters."He said the United States  "reserves [the] right to defend our personnel, our facilities, and interests and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce." "I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the Strait and to work with us in the future," Trump said.A U.S. defense official would not say how the drone was brought down when asked by CNBC.The USS Boxer is equipped with the Phalanx CIWS — close-in weapon system — for defense against threats including anti-ship missiles and helicopters.The ship also is armed with short-range anti-ship missiles and non-kinetic systems that could be capable of targeting a drone.The Pentagon, in a statement issued after the president spoke, said,  "At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz." "A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew," the Pentagon said.Earlier this month, several Iranian boats approached a British commercial ship that was passing through the Strait of Hormuz and tried to stop its passage, but were driven off by a British military ship, NBC News has reported, citing a senior defense official and a British government spokesman.A day after Iran shot down the U.S. drone on June 20, Trump approved military strikes on Iran in retaliation — but then abruptly cancelled them. "We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General," Trump wrote in a tweet on June 21. "10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not.....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone."Days later, Trump signed an executive order imposing what he called  "hard-hitting" new sanctions on Iran. "We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran until the regime abandons its dangerous activities," including its nuclear ambitions, Trump said on June 24.The new sanctions denied Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his office access to key financial resources. The sanctions also targeted Iranian military leaders who were responsible for shooting down the drone.Got a confidential news tip?

			A UBS Global Wealth Management report also predicts lab-grown food to become commercially viable in the next decade

					The market for plant-based protein is set to surge over the next decade as part of an agricultural revolution in technology, according to UBS Group AG.“Mock meat was an almost comical fad 20 years ago,” Wayne Gordon, senior Asia-Pacific strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a 67-page report. “It’s no laughing matter today, given the industry’s meteoric rise in recent years.”Beyond Meat Inc., the vegan burger maker, emerged as this year’s darling in the IPO market with shares surpassing US$200 last month compared with a US$25 offering price. UBS predicts the plant-protein market will swell to US$85 billion by 2030 from US$4.6 billion now, with the broad market for agriculture technology set to reach US$700 billion from US$135 billion.The ability to create lab-grown food “that replicates meat, fish, eggs and dairy products — with a lower carbon footprint and without the need to slaughter animals — is likely to become a commercially viable option in the next decade,” UBS said.Agriculture accounts for 40 per cent of land use, 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and 70 per cent of freshwater consumption, UBS said, citing the United Nations. Biological solutions include vertical farming, lab-grown food and artificial intelligence, the bank said.In 2018, the digital economy reached only 0.3 per cent of agriculture and trailed other industries, UBS said. The figure is poised to surge with technology investment last year up 43 per cent to US$16.9 billion from 2017, the bank said, citing AgFunder.In the outlook to 2030, UBS forecast growth of 16 per cent for both smart farming and online food delivery, 13 per cent for seed treatment and 9 per cent for seed science, and “investors should diversify their exposure and own listed and unlisted companies alike.”Bloomberg.comPostmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.

"The instruction given here correctly stated the law," the appeals panel said in its decision. " As such, we disagree with Shkreli that exclusion of additional language describing an element not required for the charged crime constituted a prejudicial error."The panel likewise dismissed Shkreli's argument that the forfeiture amount was inappropriate because not all of the investors in his hedge funds testified, that they amount should be reduced to account for losses he incurred by making trades for the funds, and that the large returns seen by investors should reduce the forefeiture to zero.Shkreli's appeals lawyer, Mark Baker, told CNBC,  "We're obviously disappointed, and we will consider and weigh whatever remedies are available."Baker said he did not think he would ask the entire Second Circuit to review the panel's decision, because  "I don't think we have a good faith basis" for such a request.But he will consider whether to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the ruling, he said.Shkreli was convicted after a 2017 trial in Brooklyn federal court where prosecutors introduced evidence that he had repeatedly lied to investors about the financial performance of two hedge funds he ran, and then used money invested in those funds to help start the pharmaceuticals company Retrophin.Shkreli was later ousted from Retrophin.He gained widespread notoriety in 2015 when another drug company he founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals, hiked the price of an anti-parasite medication used to treat pregnant women, newborns, and patients with HIV by more than 5,500%.Shkreli revelled in trolling people on social media, and in insolently responding to questions from members of Congress outraged by his price increase.On the heels of his trial, Judge Kiyo Matsumoto revoked his $5 million release bond after she found he was a danger to the public for his offer of a cash bounty for strands of hair from Hillary Clinton's head that his Facebook followers were able to grab.Got a confidential news tip?

FaceApp has gained immense popularity for allowing users to digitally alter their age, from much younger to much older. But the terms and conditions of FaceApp allow it to access to use, modify, adapt and publish any images that a user offers up in exchange for its free artificial intelligence service.LOS ANGELES - The Russia-based FaceApp has become a viral trend for its an age-altering photo filter, but its terms and conditions have been raising privacy concerns.The app has gained immense popularity for allowing users to digitally alter their age, from much younger to much older. Even celebrities have joined in, posting pictures of their youthful, current or elder selves. More than a million users have downloaded the app from Google Play, and FaceApp is now the number-one app in the Apple Store's “Photo and Video” apps section.But the terms and conditions of FaceApp allow it to access to use, modify, adapt and publish any images that a user offers up in exchange for its free artificial intelligence service. On Wednesday, the privacy concerns have led Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to send a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal Trade Commission requesting them conduct an investigation into the app. Schumer wrote that the Russia-based FaceApp "could pose national security and privacy risks for millions of U.S. citizens."  "In particular, FaceApp's location in Russia raises questions regarding how and when the company provides access to the data of U.S. citizens to third parties, including potentially foreign governments," he wrote. "I ask that the FBI assess whether the personal data uploaded by millions of Americans onto FaceApp may be finding its way into the hands of the Russian government, or entities with ties to the Russian government."Small business lawyer Elizabeth Potts Weinstein tweeted out the “User Content” section of FaceApp’s terms, saying “if you use #FaceApp you are giving them a license to use your photos, your name, your username and your likeness for any purpose including commercial purposes (like on a billboard or internet ad).” “You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate... distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content,” the FaceApp terms read.AdvertisementThe conditions explicitly stated that by using the app’s services, “you agree that the User Content may be used for commercial purposes.” The app, which was created in 2017 by Wireless Lab in St. Petersburg, Russia, will also not compensate users for the material and it will retain the image after a user has deleted the app, the Daily Mail reported.  Ariel Hochstadt, security expert from vpnMentor blog and former Gmail marketing manager for Google, told the Mail that he has warned people about apps like these before. “Hackers many time are able to record the websites that people visit, and the activities they perform in those websites, but they don't always know who are those users,” he said. “Imagine now they used the phone's camera to secretly record a young gay person, that visits gay sites, but didn't yet go public with that, and they connect his face with the websites he is using.” “They also know who this image is, with the huge DB they created of Facebook accounts and faces, and the data they have on that person is both private and accurate to the name, city and other details found on Facebook,” he said.  The Russian government doesn't need to own the database it screens against the database from the app, the Mail reported. “With so many breaches, they can get information and hack cameras that are out there, and be able to create a database of people all over the world, with information these people didn't imagine is collected on them,” Hochstadt said. The app could still be able to access photos on Apple's iOS platform even if a user has set photo permissions to “never,” Tech Crunch reported.“Unfortunately, there is still some cognitive dissonance here, because Apple allows an app to call this API even if a user has set the Photo Access setting to Never in settings,” the outlet said. But other people are also pointing out that FaceApp has similar terms and conditions to other widely used apps.Elliot Alderson, a French security researcher, tweeted out Snapchat’s terms and conditions. “You also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and public display Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed),” Snapchat’s terms said. “This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.” These apps show just how much information people give away on the internet by using a “free” service.“Your face is now a form of copyright where you need to be really careful who you give permission to access your biometric data,” Steve Sammartino, a business technology expert, told a journalist, according to the Mail.“'If you start using that willy nilly, in the future when we're using our face to access things, like our money and credit cards, then what we've done is we've handed the keys to others,” he said.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX Television Stations



As 9/11 first responders push Congress to extend funding for their care, a grim new marker was reached with the death of the 200th member of the New York City fire department from World Trade Center related illnesses.

Firefighters Kevin Nolan died on Tuesday and Richard Driscoll died on Wednesday, according to the Fire Department of New York (FDNY).

"It is almost incomprehensible that after losing 343 members on September 11, we have now had 200 more FDNY members die due to World Trade Center illness," fire commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a statement Thursday. "These heroes gave their lives bravely fighting to rescue and recover others. We will never forget them."

Congress is currently considering a 9/11 victims compensation bill that would ensure funding through 2090.

The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House overwhelmingly last week, but proponents are waiting for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the bill to the Republican-led Senate floor for a vote. The Senate bill has been held up since Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised concerns about how it would be paid for.

New York City mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted about the deaths and called for the fund to be fully funded.
"They didn’t hesitate to run into danger. They stayed until the work was done. The Senate MUST fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund," de Blasio wrote in his tweet.Rest in peace, firefighters Richard Driscoll and Kevin Nolan.200 members of the FDNY have now succumbed to WTC-related illness.

Nolan retired from the FDNY in 2007 and is survived by his wife and three adult children, the New York Daily News reported. The specific nature of his illness was not immediately publicly disclosed.

The Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York said his funeral is scheduled for Saturday. On their website, they asked all off-duty members to attend in their class A uniforms.It is with Regret we announce the WTC Related Death of Retired Firefighter Kevin J. Nolan Engine Company 79.

Driscoll, retired from the department in 2002 after serving for 32 years, was the 200th FDNY member to die of a World Trade Center-related illness, and died of cancer.

He was a Vietnam veteran and the FDNY confirmed that he had been cited five times for bravery in the course of his career.

According to a list compiled by the union, there have been eight FDNY deaths so far in 2019 as a result of World Trade Center-related illnesses.

The Intercept is a First Look Media Company.John Paul Stevens, who served on the Supreme Court for 35 years until his retirement in 2010, died this Tuesday. Just before Stevens stepped down from the bench, he authored one of the most significant opinions of his career: the main dissent in the infamous case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.“Justice Stevens clearly saw what most people know, that corporations are not people and they should not have the same political rights,” says Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission.Nine years later, we know that one specific aspect of Stevens’s warning was completely right: Citizens United did indeed make it possible for foreign money to enter the U.S. electoral system via corporations.“If taken seriously,” Stevens wrote in his opinion, “our colleagues’ assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government’s ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. … It would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans.”U.S. law strictly forbids any “foreign national” from spending money in U.S. elections. A foreign national is defined as a foreign individual, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government.Yet during the 2012 election, the notorious Malaysian financier Jho Low appears to have funneled over $1 million via an American LLC to a super PAC that supported Barack Obama’s candidacy.During the 2016 election, an investigation by The Intercept discovered, a California corporation wholly owned by Chinese citizens gave $1.3 million to a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush’s presidential candidacy.In 2017, a $100,000 donation to the Trump Victory committee — a joint fundraising committee for the 2020 Donald Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, and several state GOP parties — may also have originated with Jho Low, with an intermediate stop at an American corporation.And in 2018, an Illinois corporation largely controlled by a Canadian billionaire gave $1.75 million to a super PAC that supports Trump’s agenda.How can this be? It’s all thanks to Citizens United.Before Citizens United, contributions to candidates for federal office could only come from individual U.S. citizens in limited amounts. After Citizens United and related decisions, corporations could contribute unlimited amounts to super PACs that supported federal candidates, as long as the super PACs weren’t formally coordinating with their campaign.Citizens United did not change the prohibition on foreign nationals putting money into American elections. But the decision created a huge loophole — because as long as a company is incorporated in the United States, it is legally a U.S. national, even if it is wholly owned by foreigners.The impact of Citizens United in this area is twofold.First, if foreign-owned U.S. corporations act carefully, they may contribute as much money as they want to American super PACs, and it will all be totally legal. There are still some weak prohibitions on such donations: The decision-making process must only involve U.S. citizens, and the money must originate in the company’s U.S. operations. Charlie Spies, treasurer of the 2016 Jeb Bush super PAC and one of America’s most powerful campaign finance lawyers, wrote a memo for contributors laying out the necessary steps for a foreign-owned corporation to stay on the right side of the law.Second, Citizens United made the law against foreign contributions far more difficult to enforce. Pre-Citizens United, when money was coming solely from individuals, it was riskier for foreigners to donate, since their names would be attached and a matter of public record. Post-Citizens United, the corporate form can easily obscure the ultimate source of campaign cash.Moreover, even if a corporation can be determined to be owned by foreigners, it’s nearly impossible from the outside to determine whether they were involved in the decision to donate. In the case of the Chinese donors to Jeb Bush’s super PAC, they ultimately faced record fines by the FEC only because one accidentally blurted out the truth in an interview with The Intercept.In other words, companies with foreign ownership have been caught violating the law, but only because they got sloppy. There are almost certainly more competent actors successfully influencing U.S. politics without anyone noticing. “At the FEC, we’ve seen dramatic examples of how dark-money groups can serve as vehicles for foreign money,” says Weintraub, but “it’s been impossible to fathom its full extent.”Jon Schwarz[email protected]​theintercept.com@SchwarzEmail list managed by MailChimp


Justice Elena KaganElena KaganLiberal, conservative Supreme Court justices unite in praising Stevens Trump orders flags to half-staff in honor of Supreme Court Justice Stevens White House pays tribute to late Justice Stevens MORE on Thursday doubled down on her scathing dissent of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on partisan gerrymandering, saying that she will “never accept” the court’s majority opinion in the case.Kagan, speaking at an event at Georgetown Law, said that she “didn’t really pull my punches about the importance I thought that decision had to the political system.”The justice had authored a fiery dissent of the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling last month on partisan gerrymandering, in which the majority found that the federal judiciary cannot make rulings on the topic of politically drawn district maps."In giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the majority goes tragically wrong," she wrote in the dissent.On Thursday, Kagan said she wrote the dissenting opinion not just as a way to oppose the court ruling in the immediate future, but also to show generations to come why she believed it was wrongly decided.“You’re writing a dissent because you want to convince the future, and I guess you want to convince the present, too,” she said.Kagan also spoke about the importance of the Supreme Court upholding past precedent, a topic she also broached when dissenting on an opinion this past term that did overturn a prior ruling.That doctrine, known as stare decisis, has been raised as a topic for the court as it settles into its new conservative majority, particularly amid speculation that the justices could eventually readdress the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade.Kagan said she believes that while there are instances that the Supreme Court should overturn cases, it should be “reasons beyond just ordinary wrongness.”The Obama appointee also offered lengthy praise for the late Justice John Paul Stevens, who died this week at the age of 99 and whose seat on the bench she filled.“My gosh, what a life,” she said of Stevens, who spent 35 years on the Supreme Court, calling him an “extraordinary man and an extraordinary justice.”The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.


Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has provided the most confusing explanation yet for President Trump's racist tweets.Trump on Sunday sent tweets telling four Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to the countries they came from, inspiring his backers at a Wednesday rally to chant "send her back" after Trump attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). This sparked dozens of allegations that Trump is racist, which, as Graham oddly claimed in a Thursday tweet, apparently happens to every Republican president.Graham's statement not only doesn't defend past GOP nominees and presidents against labels of racism; it's downright coated in irony. As Omar quickly reminded the senator, he was the one calling Trump a "bigot" just a few years ago. Kathryn Krawczyk


Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) got something of a hero’s welcome the moment she arrived back to her hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota on Thursday evening.When Omar stepped out of the airport doors, she was greeted with signs and a cheering crowd welcoming her return.“Welcome home, Ilhan! Welcome home, Ilhan!” the crowd chanted.A smiling Omar can be seen making her way through the crowd throughout the chants.Rep.

Scientists call for reform, sugar regulation and transparency around dental research
Sarah Boseley Health editor

Thu 18 Jul 2019 18.30 EDT


Last modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 20.11 EDT

Scientists are calling for radical reform of dental care, tighter regulation of the sugar industry and greater transparency around conflict of interests in dental research to tackle the high and rising toll of oral disease such as mouth cancers.In a challenge to the global health community, a series in the Lancet medical journal argues that 3.5 billion people suffering from oral disease have been let down.Oral disease includes tooth decay, gum disease and oral cancer and affects almost half of the global population. Untreated dental decay is the most common health condition worldwide. Lip and oral cavity cancers are among the top 15 most common cancers in the world, say researchers.“Dentistry is in a state of crisis,” said Prof Richard Watt, chair and honorary consultant in dental public health at University College London and the lead author of the series. “Current dental care and public health responses have been largely inadequate, inequitable and costly, leaving billions of people without access to even basic oral health care.“While this breakdown in the delivery of oral healthcare is not the fault of individual dental clinicians committed to caring for their patients, a fundamentally different approach is required to effectively tackle to the global burden of oral diseases.”High-tech treatment has taken priority over prevention in wealthy countries such as the UK, say the researchers. Around the world, the heavy marketing of sugary drinks is causing increasing damage to dental health, they argue.By 2020 Coca-Cola intends to spend $12bn (£9.5bn) on marketing its products across Africa, in contrast to WHO’s total annual budget in 2017 of $4.4bn, they write.Watt said: “Sugar consumption is the primary cause of tooth decay. The UK population is consuming far too much sugar – considerably higher than the Department of Health and WHO recommends.“A particular concern is the high levels of sugar in processed commercial baby foods and drinks which encourage babies and toddlers to develop a preference for sweetness in early life. We need tighter regulation and legislation to restrict the marketing and promotion of sugary foods and drinks if we are to tackle the root causes of oral conditions.”Cristin Kearns, of the University of California, San Francisco, and Prof Lisa Bero, of the University of Sydney, warn in a linked commentary of financial links between dental research organisations and the processed food and drink industries.“Emerging evidence of industry influence on research agendas contributes to the plausibility that major food and beverage brands could view financial relationships with dental research organisations as an opportunity to ensure a focus on commercial applications for dental caries interventions – such as xylitol, oral hygiene instruction, fluoridated toothpaste and sugar-free chewing gum – while deflecting attention from harm caused by their sugary products,” they write.


Patents
Drug prices are sky high. This is not news. A bunch of incredibly dumb policy decisions have been stacked up for decades and brought us to this place where drug prices -- especially for life-saving drugs -- would bankrupt most people. A huge part of the problem is our patent system and how we literally grant monopolies to companies over these drugs. Combine "life saving" with "monopoly" and, uh, you don't have to have a PhD in economics to know what happens to the price. Add into that our fucked up and convoluted hospital and insurance healthcare system, in which prices are hidden from patients, and you have a recipe for the most insanely exploitative "marketplace" ever.

The NY Times has taken notice of this and its editorial board recently put forth some partial solutions that could be done right away to ease the burden. This includes having the federal government flat-out seize patents:

Consider seizing patents. Two statutes enable the federal government to override patents on F.D.A.-approved medications and produce them at cost. The first, known as Section 1498, works as a sort of eminent domain and allows the government to override any patent if the patent holder is compensated fairly. The provision was invoked frequently in the 1950s and ’60s to obtain crucial medications at a discount. Its use waned in later decades as the drug industry’s influence over government grew.

The second statute, known as march-in rights, allows the federal government to take similar action on any product invented with government money. The United States has never used this power for a prescription drug, but a growing number of policy experts and consumer advocates are pressing the federal government to use it now, for drugs like Truvada (the only drug approved to prevent infection with H.I.V.), which the government funded and holds some patents on. Patent overrides certainly won’t work for every medication, but they have been used successfully in the past to force the drug industry to the negotiating table. Mr. Trump could send a powerful signal to drug makers if he utilized them now.

Of course, the idea that the Trump administration is going to start seizing prescription drug patents is kind of laughable. And, man, the legal battles to watch over that would be quite impressive. But, to me, it shows just how bad things have gotten that a paper like the NY Times would casually toss out having the government seize private company patents to deal with the insanity of drug pricing.

Furthermore, while the Times is correct that this could be "done now," it seems like yet another way of treating the symptoms not the disease. Fix the fucking patent system. Fix our broken healthcare system. Do those two things and you don't have insane drug pricing any more. And, to be fair, at least the NY Times piece does acknowledge the idea that maybe we need to "blow up the patent system and start over" when it comes to pharmaceuticals. But it labels this idea as "fantastical." It may be "fantastical" to those with limited imaginations and focused on living under today's crappy, broken system. But if we want to deal with the real problems, that's one area to start.

 is fantastical.In the same sense that a constitutional convention is a fantastical way to solve dilemmas between desirable social outcomes (say gun control) and current interpretations of the constitution. You may go in with the intention of solving a critical problem, but what comes out after hearings, lobbying, compromises and campaign donations will look like Obamacare: way more complicated than it could have been and doesn't really address the problem because of obstructions thrown up by those profiting from the current system.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]
 We could have perfect transparency, but that wouldn't solve the problem.Doctor: Treatment A costs $10 and has a 95.1% chance of saving your life. Treatment B costs $1,000,000 and has a 95.3% change of saving your life.Either way, your insurance company will pay for it.Patient: I'll take Treatment B. 95.3% is higher than 95.1%.Unless patients and doctors (whoever's doing the deciding) bear the costs instead of 3rd parties, we're never, ever going to fix this problem.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]
 That is perhaps an argument against a 3rd party healthcare system. (Which obviously would be impossible to implement (See Europe, where such a system costs hundreds of dollars for office visits, giant co-pays, and impossible premiums.)) Hower not seeing what that has to do with the IP monopoly in the article, and how the patent-lock in allows drug manufacturers to jack up the prices on drugs with no fear of competition. Drug prices which are only going up now that the patent holders see how well it's working (for them) every time they do it.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]
 A 3rd party system where the 3rd party that's paying ALSO decides on treatments (as per the British NHS) is completely compatible what I described.The problem is that party A decides on treatment, and party B gets to pay for it. That's what's unworkable.If we do move to a universal healthcare system in the US (not what I advocate, but it would be no worse that the current mess), ultimately the Feds will decide who gets what treatment.There is no other practical solution.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]

 This was part of the plot of an episode in the most recent season of DESIGNATED SURVIVOR.Kiefer Sutherland's president used the march-in rights to seize the patent on a cancer drug that was being sold for $20,000/pill. As soon as they did, the drug company was eagerly willing to discuss lowering the price.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]
 As patents are government granted monopolies, if a company or person abuses that monopoly, the government should be within its rights to invalidate that said patent and thereby placing it in the public domain. The government shouldn’t seize the patent, which keeps the monopoly alive with potential repeat abuse. Although, if federal funds were used, an argument for seizure over simply invalidating and placing into the public domain could make sense.[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]

												​WASHINGTON – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked acting ​Homeland Security head Kevin McAleenan how so many Border Patrol agents ended up in a Facebook group where “rape memes” featuring the congresswoman were shared.AOC started her line of questioning in Thursday’s House Oversight Committee hearing by asking McAleenan if he had seen ProPublica’s report on the 3-year-old secret Facebook group, characterizing it as “violently racist and sexist.” ​“I’m aware of the ProPublica article, yes,” McAleenan answered.She then asked if he had seen any of the posts.He had.“Did you see the reports mocking migrant children’s deaths?” she asked.He did.“Did you see the post planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar​?” she continued.Rep. Veronica Escobar, a guest of the committee for the hearing, was seated at the rostrum beside her.McAleenan said he had seen that as well – and had promptly asked that it be investigated.“Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?” Ocasio-Cortez asked.McAleenan said yes.“Are those officers on the job today and responsible for the safety of migrant women and children?” ​she pressed.The acting DHS head wasn’t sure.“We’ve already put individuals on administrative duties, I don’t know which ones corresponded to which post​,” he said.​“Do you think that the policy of child separation could have contributed to a dehumanizing culture within CBP that contributes and kind of spills over to other areas of conduct?” Ocasio-Cortez asked.McAleenan said that there was not a “dehumanizing culture” at ​the agency.“So you don’t think having 10,000 officers in a violent, racist group sharing rape memes of members of Congress points to any concern of a dehumanized culture?” ​she said.McAleenan called the posts “unacceptable.”“They’re being investigated, but I don’t think it’s fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even members of that group believed or supported those posts,” he answered.Earlier in the hearing​,​ he said Congress would see the fruits of that investigation by later this month or next.“How did 10,000 members join this group?” the New York Democrat also asked. “How were they in this Facebook group without anybody knowing?McAleenan answered, “Again this is the subject of an ongoing investigation.”Ocasio-Cortez stayed away from other hot-button issues regarding DHS, as President Trump at a rally Wednesday night said she lied when she said migrants were drinking out of toilets.But that didn’t mean they went unheard.Even before it was AOC’s turn at bat, McAleenan tried pushing back on some of her claims.The acting DHS head called it “a requirement by our policy” to provide migrants with water.“Sometimes a faucet will break temporarily,” he offered, when Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) asked if he had heard about detainees having to drink from toilets.That was the headline that came out of a ​trip to a ​Texas border facility taken by Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus earlier this month.McAleenan testified that claim was “totally unsubstantiated.”Hice also asked McAleenan’s take on ​Ocasio-Cortez’s labeling border facilities “concentration camps.”McAleenan called it “unproductive and unprofessional” to be “demonizing” DHS officials.But Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings had no problem tearing into McAleenan over the tracking of separated children and some of the squalid conditions that have been reported.“You think you’re doing a great job, right?” Cummings asked.McAleenan tried answering, “We’re doing our level best in a very challenging …” before he was cut off.“What does that mean? What does that mean? When a child is sitting in their own feces?” Cummings shouted. “Can’t take a shower. Come on, man. What’s that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.”Cummings said he was tired of people saying that the Democrats were merely beating up on Border Patrol agents or Homeland Security officials.The Oversight chairman called the US “the greatest country in the world” that has the ability to save people around the world. “Make sure that they have diapers, make sure that they have toothbrushes. Make sure that they’re not laying around defecating in some silver paper,” Cummings said. “Come on, we’re better than that.”A short time later, McAleenan also called reports that children didn’t have toothbrushes “totally unsubstantiated.”“There’s no one def​ecating in a Mylar blanket,” he also testified.

CNN aired a panel that featured “Republican women” defending President Trump’s racist tweets, but failed to mention that they were actually part of a pro-Trump group whose members the network had interviewed in the past.On Tuesday, the network aired a segment that included a panel of “Republican women,” seemingly or presumably selected at random, who defended Trump’s “go back” tweets aimed at four Democratic congresswomen of color. “These eight Republican women from Dallas don't see anything wrong with President Trump telling four Democratic congressman to go back where they came from,” CNN’s Randi Kaye said, introducing the women. “I'm glad that the president said what he said because all they are doing is they are inciting hatred and division,” one of the women, Gian O’Briant, told Kaye, adding that “he didn't say anything about color.”Another woman, Peaches McGuire Coates, was upset that Kaye mentioned that the four representatives Trump attacked were women of color.“Why do you keep bringing that up?” she asked. “It's idiotic, what they're saying. So, it doesn't matter whether they're white, man, woman, brown, yellow, anything.”CNN failed to mention that both O’Briant and Coates had been featured in CNN segments defending Trump before. Though they were previously billed as “Trump supporters,” CNN simply referred to them as “Republican women” in this week’s segment.The network also failed to mention that the women were part of a pro-Trump group called the Trumpettes of America 2019 Palm Beach Team, the Washington Post reported. Coates and O’Briant were previously listed as members of a group called Texas Women for Trump Coalition when they appeared on the network in September of last year to praise Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But Coates, O’Briant and fellow panelist Dena Miller were also interviewed in January of last year ahead of Trump’s State of the Union speech, with no affiliations being listed. The women defended Trump amid what were then allegations that he paid Stormy Daniels hush money to keep quiet about their alleged affair.“You know, what bothers me are these stories that detract from all the good things he’s doing for the American people,” O’Briant told Kaye during that segment. “Instead of hearing that, we’re hearing all news from someone that’s not really that credible, from a stripper porn star.”Both instances are a clear violation of journalistic ethics. The Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics instructs journalists to give viewers proper context and “identify sources clearly. The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources.”Edward Wasserman, the dean of the University of California at Berkeley journalism school, called the lack of disclosure “a fraud on the viewer.” Fred Brown, a member of the SPJ ethics committee, told the Post that he doesn’t believe the lack of disclosure was intentional but accused the network of “incomplete reporting.”“I don’t see any good reason for CNN not to identify the affiliation of these women,” he also said. “It’s a useful bit of information to help viewers evaluate the women’s motivation and mind-set.”Not only did CNN fail to disclose the women’s affiliations in the segment that ran on the network, there is similarly no mention of their group in the archived video on CNN’s website, titled “These GOP women see nothing wrong with Trump's comments,” or even in CNN's published article (which features six bylines) about the segment, titled “These Republican women say they stand behind Trump and don't see his recent tweets as racist.”Media Matters reported that during one replay of the segment on Wednesday, daytime anchor Ana Cabrera finally mentioned that “several” of the women on the panel “are affiliated with groups that support President Trump.” Igor Derysh is a New York-based political writer whose work has appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Boston Herald and Baltimore Sun.••• • • •Copyright © 2018 Salon Media Group, Inc.

The remains, dating from the 7th or 8th century, were found in the Bedouin town of Rahat.Israel's Antiquities Authority (IAA) says the mosque was unearthed during building work in the area.It is the first known mosque from this period in the area, rivalling the age of those found in Mecca and Jerusalem, the IAA said.Excavation directors Jon Seligman and Shahar Zur said the mosque would be "a rare discovery anywhere in the world". Researchers believe the mosque's congregation were likely to have been local farmers. The building was open-air, rectangular-shaped and had a "Mihrab" - or a prayer niche - facing south toward Mecca, Islam's holiest city. "These features are evidence for the purpose for which this building was used, many hundred years ago," said Mr Seligman. It is one of the first mosques constructed after the arrival of Islam in what is present-day Israel, when the Arabs conquered the then-Byzantine province in 636, according to Gideon Avni, an expert on early Islamic history.  "The discovery of the village and the mosque in its vicinity are a significant contribution to the study of the history of the country during this turbulent period," he said.

AdvertisementSupported byThe rest of us can love America well.By David BrooksOpinion ColumnistSo apparently Donald Trump wants to make this an election about what it means to be American. He’s got his vision of what it means to be American, and he’s challenging the rest of us to come up with a better one.In Trump’s version, “American” is defined by three propositions. First, to be American is to be xenophobic. The basic narrative he tells is that the good people of the heartland are under assault from aliens, elitists and outsiders. Second, to be American is to be nostalgic. America’s values were better during some golden past. Third, a true American is white. White Protestants created this country; everybody else is here on their sufferance.When you look at Trump’s American idea you realize that it contradicts the traditional American idea in every particular. In fact, Trump’s national story is much closer to the Russian national story than it is toward our own. It’s an alien ideology he’s trying to plant on our soil. Trump’s vision is radically anti-American.The real American idea is not xenophobic, nostalgic or racist; it is pluralistic, future-oriented and universal. America is exceptional precisely because it is the only nation on earth that defines itself by its future, not its past. America is exceptional because from the first its citizens saw themselves in a project that would have implications for all humankind. America is exceptional because it was launched with a dream to take the diverse many and make them one — e pluribus unum.The Puritans settled this continent with visions of creating a future city on a hill. They had an eschatological dreams of completing God’s plan for this earth. By the time of the revolution it was well understood that America was the land of futurity, the vanguard nation that would lead all of humanity to a dignified and democratic future.“I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder,” John Adams declared, “as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth.”American life is so raucous and dynamic because people are inflamed by visions of creating a heaven on earth. As George Santayana put it, Americans often don’t make a distinction between the sacred and the profane. In building material wealth, they see themselves creating a country that will redeem humanity, that will become the last best hope of earth.This sense of mission has often made Americans arrogant, and somewhat dangerous to be around. But it has also made us anxious. The country was built amid a wail of jeremiads: Providence assigned us a mission to serve the whole planet, but we, in our greed and sin, are blowing it! “Ah my country!” Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented, “In thee is the reasonable hope of mankind not fulfilled.”But the American mission survived its failures. Herman Melville summarized the ethos in his novel “White Jacket”: “God has predestined, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls. … We are the pioneers of the world; the advance-guard, sent on through the wilderness of untried things, to break a new path.”Again and again, Americans have felt called upon to launch off into new frontiers — to design a democracy, to create a new kind of democratic person, to settle the West, to industrialize, to pioneer new technologies, to explore space, to combat prejudice, to fight totalitarianism and spread democracy. The mission was always the same: to leap into the future, to give life meaning and shape by extending opportunity and dignity to all races and nations.This American idea is not a resentful prejudice; it’s a faith and a dream. The historian Sacvan Bercovitch put it best: “Only ‘America,’ of all national designations, took on the combined force of eschatology and chauvinism. Many forms of nationalism have laid claims to a world-redeeming promise; many Christian sects have sought, in open or secret heresy, to find the sacred in the profane; many European Protestants have linked the soul’s journey and the way to wealth.“But only the ‘American Way,’ of all modern symbologies, has managed to circumvent the contradictions inherent in these approaches. Of all symbols of identity, only ‘American’ has succeeded in uniting nationality with universality, civic and spiritual selfhood, sacred and secular history, the country’s past and the paradise to be, in a single transcendent ideal.”Trump’s campaign is an attack on that dream. The right response is to double down on that ideal. The task before us is to create the most diverse mass democracy in the history of the planet — a true universal nation. It is precisely to weave the social fissures that Trump is inclined to tear.Americans have always been divided on where they came from, but united in their vision of their common future. They’ve been bonded by the vision of creating a pluralistic home in which everybody can belong and be seen.

ODESSA, Tx (KOSA) --  Odessa Police arrested a 15-year-old boy for spitting in an Arizona Tea bottle and putting it back for someone else to drink.An officer wrote in a sworn affidavit that he was dispatched to the Albertsons on North County Road West Monday night.He says he watched security camera video with the asset protection officer and saw the teen pick up the drink, put his mouth on it, then put it back.The affidavit goes on to say the teen told the asset protection manager before the police officer arrived that he spit in it.The police officer says the teen repeatedly told him that he took a drink of the tea, then put it back, because it was "gross."He's charged with tampering with a consumer product, which is a second degree felony.He's being held in the Ector County Youth Center.

In a move that is bound to piss off more than a couple of publishers, Google is readying to fix the “loophole” that allowed sites to see when you’re browsing in Incognito Mode.Google announced in a blog post on Thursday that the update will arrive with the release of Chrome 76 later this month. The tip-off to sites that you’re browsing in private mode is an unintended result of Chrome’s FileSystem API, which is disabled in Incognito. If a site searches for the FileSystem API and gets an error message, it can, as Google puts it, “give the user a different experience.”Advertisement“With the release of Chrome 76 scheduled for July 30, the behavior of the FileSystem API will be modified to remedy this method of Incognito Mode detection,” the company said.News of this kind of behavior by websites has been cropping up for years, and it’s a huge pain in the ass if you’re, say, trying to get around a publisher’s paywall. But while it’s kind of a bummer for publishers if they can’t force you to log in, subscribe, or switch to a normal browsing mode, Google notes there are serious circumstances under which Incognito Mode users might need to protect their privacy, including political oppression or domestic abuse.AdvertisementThis is just the latest development in Google’s performative privacy campaign as it works to keep up with every other tech giant waving their own ostensible privacy flag. But given the fact that this has been an issue for years now, fixing it seems like the very least that Google could do—particularly given its own admission that some of its users may rely on Incognito for protection beyond simply skirting a site’s views meter.That said, it’s still a welcome update. Google also noted that in addition to fixing the FileSystem API loophole, it will “likewise work to remedy any other current or future means of Incognito Mode detection.”AdvertisementStaff Reporter


Image: Cathryn VirginiaArtificial intelligence has been touted by some in the security community as the silver bullet in malware detection. Its proponents say it’s superior to traditional antivirus since it can catch new variants and never-before-seen malware—think zero-day exploits—that are the Achilles heel of antivirus. One of its biggest proponents is the security firm BlackBerry Cylance, which has staked its business model on the artificial intelligence engine in its endpoint PROTECT detection system, which the company says has the ability to detect new malicious files two years before their authors even create them. But researchers in Australia say they’ve found a way to subvert the machine-learning algorithm in PROTECT and cause it to falsely tag already known malware as “goodware.” The method doesn’t involve altering the malicious code, as hackers generally do to evade detection. Instead, the researchers developed a “global bypass” method that works with almost any malware to fool the Cylance engine. It involves simply taking strings from a non-malicious file and appending them to a malicious one, tricking the system into thinking the malicious file is benign.The benign strings they used came from an online gaming program, which they have declined to name publicly so that Cylance will have a chance to fix the problem before hackers exploit it.“As far as I know, this is a world-first, proven global attack on the ML [machine learning] mechanism of a security company,” says Adi Ashkenazy, CEO of the Sydney-based company Skylight Cyber, who conducted the research with CTO Shahar Zini. “After around four years of super hype [about AI], I think this is a humbling example of how the approach provides a new attack surface that was not possible with legacy [antivirus software].”The method works because Cylance’s machine-learning algorithm has a bias toward the benign file that causes it to ignore any malicious code and features in a malicious file if it also sees strings from the benign file attached to a malicious file—essentially overriding the correct conclusion the detection engine should otherwise make. The trick works even if the Cylance engine previously concluded the same file was malicious, before the benign strings were appended to it.The researchers tested their attack against the WannaCry ransomware that crippled hospitals and businesses around the world in 2017, as well as the more recent Samsam ransomware, the popular Mimikatz hacking tool, and hundreds of other known malicious files—adding the same benign strings from the gaming program to each malicious file—and in nearly all cases, they were able to trick the Cylance engine.Martijn Grooten, editor of Virus Bulletin, which conducts tests and reviews of malware detection programs, called the reverse-engineering research impressive and technically interesting, but wasn’t surprised by the findings.“Their crime is not that they coded AI poorly. Their crime is calling what they did AI."“This is how AI works. If you make it look like benign files, then you can do this,” Grooten told Motherboard. “It mostly shows that you can’t rely on AI on its own…. AI isn’t a silver bullet…. I suspect it’ll get better at this kind of thing over time.”A machine learning expert Motherboard spoke to agrees.“Usually you try to work with machine learning to cover … things which are widely unknown or you cannot do manually,” said the expert, who asked to remain anonymous because his company doesn’t authorize him to speak with media. “And it usually works pretty well, until you have some corner cases where you can’t just make the model [work].”Though he doesn’t fault Cylance for making a mistake, he does fault the company for hyping the AI in their marketing when the system contains a bias that essentially undermines the AI.“Their crime is not that they coded AI poorly. Their crime is calling what they did AI,” he told Motherboard.Cylance ranks about eight among the top ten endpoint security companies, after Symantec, Kaspersky and TrendMicro. But the company’s business is growing rapidly; last year it obtained $120 million in funding and this year was acquired by BlackBerry in a $1.4 billion deal. Cylance’s PROTECT isn’t the only security product that uses artificial intelligence. Other firms like Symantec, Crowdstrike, and Darktrace use it too, but Ashkenazy and Zini didn’t test those systems and it’s not clear they would suffer from the same bias, since they’re architected differently and don’t rely as heavily on machine learning to detect malicious files as the Cylance system does.“One of [Cylance’s] selling points… they say no more running after signatures and updates. We train the model once, and … you won’t have to train the model again for a couple of years. It’s very compelling, if it actually works,” Ashkenazy said. But to fix the problem he and his colleague found in the Cylance engine, the company will have to retrain the system, which could be a “costly and complex process” Ashkenazy said.Artificial intelligence has several advantages over traditional antivirus. In traditional systems, the vendor has to analyze each new file and push out new signatures or heuristics to their scanners to detect it. (Signatures look for specific strings of code or data that are unique to a piece of malware; heuristics look at the activity the code is engaged in to spot actions that are characteristic of malware.) But, according to Cylance, its engine doesn’t require an update every time new malware, or variants of existing malware, are discovered. Machine-learning detection systems are supposed to recognize not only known malicious files and activity but also spot new ones.In a test conducted by SELabs and commissioned by Cylance, a version of its 2015 software had the ability to detect variants of the Cerber ransomware and other malicious programs that didn’t appear in the wild until 2016 and 2018.To determine if a file is malicious or benign, the Cylance engine looks at 4 million different features or data points, according to Ryan Permeh, founder and chief scientist of Cylance. These include things like the size of the file, structural elements present, and entropy (the level of randomness), etc. Cylance programmers then “train” the engine by showing it about a billion malicious and benign files and tweak the system to hone its detection. But during training, the system also examines the files for patterns to see how malware variants evolve over time to anticipate how new malware might look—essentially “predicting” what malware authors will do before they do it. Models do get retrained, Permeh says, but only about every six months, and users only have to update their software if they want the latest features and performance improvements.But none of this training and testing matter if the algorithm has a bias that is also training it to ignore what it learns from that other training. That’s essentially what the Skylight Cyber researchers discovered.They purchased a copy of the Cylance program and reverse-engineered it to figure out what features or data points the agent was looking at to determine if a file is benign or malicious and they also studied how these features are weighed to arrive at the score the program gives each files. The Cylance system analyzes each file based on these data points, and assigns a score to the file that ranges between -1,000 to 1,000 (with -1,000 being a file with the most or worst malicious features or data points in it). Scores are visible in the program’s log file.When they saw how many features the program analyzes, the researchers worried initially that it would take them weeks or months to find the ones that carried the most weight in the algorithm’s decision process. That is, until they discovered that Cylance also had whitelisted certain families of executable files to avoid triggering false positives on legitimate software.Suspecting the machine learning might be biased toward code in those whitelisted files, they extracted strings from an online gaming program Cylance had whitelisted and appended it to malicious files. The Cylance engine tagged the files benign and moved their scores from high negative numbers to high positive ones. The score for Mimikatz went from -799 to 998. WannaCry went from -1000 to 545. The researchers liken it to donning a mask with a beak and having a facial recognition system identify you as a bird, ignoring all other characteristics that indicate you’re just a person wearing an artificial beak.They tested the top ten malware programs cited by the Center for Internet Security, then broadened their test to include 384 additional malicious files taken from online repositories of malware. The average score before they appended the benign strings from the whitelisted gaming program was -0.92. After adding the strings, the average score was 0.63. About 84 percent of the files bypassed detection once they added the gaming strings, though some files still got tagged malicious, but with significantly changed scores than before. They didn’t just run the files against the static Cylance program - they executed the malicious files on a virtual machine with Cylance PROTECT running on it, to see if it would catch the malicious files in action. The theory was that even if the product was tricked by the strings, the malicious action of the file would still be detected by Cylance, but it wasn’t.Ashkenazy said the use of whitelisting in an AI program is odd, but understands why Cylance did it, if its engine was creating false positives on those programs. The real problem, he said, was giving the whitelisted programs more weight in the algorithm’s scoring, causing them to override a decision the algorithm would normally reach if a file didn’t have the benign strings appended to it. He also said that not using backup signatures or heuristics to doublecheck the algorithm’s conclusion, and relying on the AI instead, caused the failures.Permeh, who is also the architect of Cylance’s machine-learning engine, said they do use signatures and hard-coded heuristics in their product as well and don’t entirely rely on the machine-learning, but the AI does take precedence in detection. He acknowledged to Motherboard the potential for the kind of bypass the researchers found, however.“Generally speaking, in all of these AI scenarios, models are probabilistic. When you train one, you learn what’s good and what’s bad…. By training for what is a good file, we learn attributes of that… [and] it’s entirely possible that we overestimated the goodness of that,” he told Motherboard in a phone call. "One of the interesting parts of being basically the first to take an AI-first approach, is that we’re still learning. We invest a lot in adverse research, but this is still an evolution.”Contrary to what Ashkenazy said, Permeh doesn’t think it will take long to retrain the algorithm to fix the issue once he knows the details of the global bypass. Ashkenazy didn’t contact Cylance before contacting Motherboard to disclose the issue.But Ashkenazy thinks the issue will take more time to fix than Permeh believes.“The bias towards games and those features is there for a reason,” Ashkenazy said. “They were getting false positives for games, so retraining without sacrificing accuracy or false positive rate can’t be that simple.”In the end, Ashkenzy doesn’t think Cylance is at fault for using machine learning, just for hyping it and relying on it so heavily for detection.“I actually think they did a decent job applying current AI technology to security,” he told Motherboard. “It just has inherent flaws, like the possibility of having an exploitable bias which becomes a global bypass with a costly fix.”  Subscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.

He had another big story in the works, and the atmosphere around his home office was frenetic: Dogs barking, 27 security cameras filming, big men with guns standing guard.For weeks, from a house transformed into a bunker, Greenwald had published allegations casting doubt on the impartiality of the corruption investigation that led to the imprisonment of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and contributed to the rise of President Jair Bolsonaro.In two days, he would publish another story alleging that the judge who’d overseen Lula’s case, Sérgio Moro, a national hero in Brazil for his role taking on corruption, had colluded with prosecutors to convict him.“This material is going to come out,” he said. “Even if they put me in prison.”The prospect felt real enough. Greenwald, the polarizing American journalist who came to prominence reporting on the U.S. government surveillance programs exposed by Edward Snowden, had promised months of stories — a steady drip of leaks that could imperil the Bolsonaro agenda. Some members of Brazil's National Congress had called for his deportation. Others accused him of committing a crime. Death threats were rolling in.Most recently, the federal police, commanded by Moro, now Bolsonaro’s justice minister, reportedly began investigating Greenwald’s finances in a probe that press advocates here see as an attempt to silence him.The public threats against Greenwald represent an early test for Brazil under Bolsonaro, the right-wing former military officer who won the presidency last year with appeals to nationalism, homophobia and nostalgia for the country’s two-decade military dictatorship.Will this government tolerate damaging reporting by a gay foreign journalist? Or will it move to silence him, confirming fears of Bolsonaro’s potential for authoritarianism?“There are all of these lurking questions that have found a vehicle for expression in this story,” Greenwald said. “It’s more than just Sérgio Moro. It’s about what kind of government we’re going to have.”He’s the ‘hero’ judge who oversaw Brazil’s vast Car Wash corruption probe. Now he’s facing his own scandal.Greenwald moved to Rio in 2005, after meeting the man who would become his husband while vacationing here. Over the next decade, as he covered American issues from afar, he built a Brazilian life. His husband, David Miranda, is a socialist member of Congress. They adopted two Brazilian children and opened a dog shelter. They now live in a cavernous house, built around a giant boulder, on a leafy street in a gated community near a mountain.His divisive reporting and opinions have long attracted fans in the United States — and also critics, some of whom he has viciously attacked online: “You idiot” is a favorite epithet on Twitter.It wasn’t until 2016, however, that he became a polarizing figure here, too. The impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, Lula’s anointed successor, was cleaving the country along partisan lines. Greenwald started writing Portuguese-language columns critical of the proceedings. They found a massive audience, convincing him there was room here for an investigative news site.The Intercept Brasil, launched in August 2016 as a Portuguese-language offshoot of the online news organization Greenwald co-founded two years earlier, joined a media industry that would soon be strained by a divisive political campaign, the imprisoning of Lula and the ascent of Bolsonaro. The right-wing candidate made attacks on the mainstream media a pillar of his campaign.“Bolsonaro uses Trump as a role model,” said Rosental Calmon Alves, director of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin. “Part of Trumpism is attacking the press and having the press as the enemy. Bolsonaro has tried to play by the same playbook.”Bolsonaro supporters harassed and threatened fact-checkers, advocates for the press say. The Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism counted nearly 62 instances of physical aggression against journalists in 2018 in a political context.“The fact that we had to create a systematic survey of instances — a need that had not been perceived until then — shows that the last campaign was atypical,” said the organization’s executive manager, Marina Iemini Atoji.When Bolsonaro won the election, Paris-based Reporters Without Borders called him “a serious threat to press freedom and ­democracy in Brazil.”It was in this context, Greenwald says, that a person — he declined to say who — got in touch to offer information that would send tremors through the political order.A central figure in the archive of materials he obtained was Moro, one of Brazil’s most popular people, seen by many as a crusader for public probity.The Intercept’s first story, published in early June, challenged that narrative. It alleged that Moro had worked inappropriately with federal prosecutors to imprison Lula, the leader in presidential polls, clearing Bolsonaro’s path to the presidency. Moro has denied wrongdoing.Brazil’s top anti-corruption judge joins Bolsonaro government amid outcryThe reporting triggered responses that reflected the country’s divisions. While a majority disapproved of his alleged communications with prosecutors during the “Car Wash” investigation, polling has shown, most have continued to support him. And Greenwald, who has never hidden his disdain for Bolsonaro, found himself facing an accusation he’s heard before: that he’s less a journalist than an activist.“He’s very clearly positioned in Brazil,” said Oliver Stuenkel, an assistant professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo. “A lot of people say he has an agenda and he’s not objective.”Soon the story became as much about Greenwald — his sexuality, his marriage to a Brazilian man, his status as a foreigner — as about the allegations the Intercept was publishing.Carlos Bolsonaro, the president’s son, fanned conspiracy theories and appeared to call Greenwald’s husband a girl. An online petition for the journalist’s deportation amassed nearly 100,000 signatures. Homophobic messages tore across social media. Moro said the Intercept was “allied” with “criminal hackers.”Then this month, the website Antagonist, which has a reputation in Brazil as anti-Lula, reported that the federal police were investigating Greenwald’s finances. Officials have declined to confirm or deny an investigation.“Our constitution is very hard in the defense of freedom of expression and the press,” said Leandro Demori, executive editor of the Intercept Brasil. “But are our institutions strong enough to protect the constitution? I don’t think so. I really don’t. We’re afraid.”Greenwald is inclined to agree. He experienced threats and denunciations in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. But this feels different, he said. It’s more personal.“In Snowden, I was only the reporter,” Greenwald said. “In this case, there’s no identifiable source, so they’ve personally identified me, like I was the person who took the material.“I’m a good target. I’m a foreigner. I’m gay. I’m married to a socialist politician.”He looked outside for a moment, where it was all sun and foliage. He says Brazil is still “paradise.” But beyond the trees were concrete walls, now freshly fortified with coils of electrified barbed wire. These days he rarely ventures beyond its barrier, he said, for fear of assassination.Still, he has no plans of leaving.“I don’t look at this as a foreign place,” he said. “It’s my home.”Cocaine, leaks and opposition: Brazil’s Bolsonaro challenged by scandal, defeatsBrazil’s new leaders are challenging the tradition of participatory democracy.

Washington, D.C. – The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ought to follow its own rules designed to protect the independence and effectiveness of the agency’s scientific advisory committees, writes the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a report released this week by U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Tom Carper (D-DE). By ignoring the agency’s own rules, the Trump officials at the EPA installed industry scientists and consultants to help guide the EPA’s scientific decision making to favor polluting industries, the senators note. “This non-partisan report makes clear that the Trump Administration skirted ethics requirements, purging advisory committees of independent scientists and replacing them with mouthpieces for industry,” said Bennet. “In the midst of a climate crisis, this administration has undermined science at every turn.”“This report shows that the Trump administration rigged influential advisory boards to favor its polluter backers.  In the process, they also slowed down the work of the committees, delaying key decisions on whether to regulate potentially dangerous environmental hazards,” said Whitehouse. “The GAO’s findings are yet another example Donald Trump handing the keys to Americans’ government to big industries that government is supposed to police.”“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” said Carper. “This is not a trivial issue, but a serious problem that has profound consequences for enforcement and regulatory actions across the agency.  Not only is EPA putting the interests of polluters over public health, but this report demonstrates once again how little this administration values basic science.”In 2017, the senators asked the GAO to examine the independence of the EPA’s 22 scientific advisory committees, which advise the agency on environmental science, public health, safety, and other subjects central to the EPA’s work. Subsequently, former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt barred scientists receiving EPA grants from serving on these committees and replaced many members with industry-backed scientists who have worked directly for corporations and industry groups the EPA is charged with regulating.  Pruitt’s directive established an obvious double standard that favors polluting industries over academic researchers.In its report, the GAO finds that the EPA failed follow the rules in staffing two key advisory boards that have been at the center of significant controversy.  The “EPA did not follow a key step in its established process for appointing 20 members . . . to the [Science Advisory Board (SAB)] and [Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC)], which advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things,” the GAO concluded. In addition, the GAO documented a significant change in the composition of the SAB and EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC). According to the GAO, “[t]here was a notable decrease in the percentage of members affiliated with academic institutions” on these two boards.The Trump Administration’s handling of BOSC has stirred major controversy. Early in the Trump Administration, the EPA announced it would not renew the terms of dozens of scientists on BOSC even though many of them would have served half as long as typical appointees. No cause was given for their dismissal. EPA’s notice to the scientists triggered resignations and the cancelation of five of BOSC’s subcommittee hearings scheduled for the fall of 2017 due to lack of membership. “It effectively wipes out the BOSC and leaves it free for a complete reappointment,” BOSC Executive Chairwoman Deborah Swackhamer told the Washington Post. The New York Times reported that EPA political staff also pressured Swackhamer to change her testimony before Congress about the termination of these scientists. The influential SAB has also been an area of concern. The GAO report notes a marked decrease in the number of scientists affiliated with academic institutions on EPA advisory boards since the beginning of the Trump Administration, giving way for industry scientists. This pattern follows similar findings from other reviews of advisory board staffing. According to the Center for Investigative Reporting, “Under the Obama administration, industry-affiliated scientists made up 40 percent of the Science Advisory Board, or 19 of its 47 members. Under President Donald Trump, 68 percent of the board, 30 of its 44 current members, now has ties to industries.”Likewise, the CASAC has been a lightning rod. The litany of concerns with Trump administration staffing of the committee includes:In addition to Bennet, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined Whitehouse and Carper to request the report.The GAO report is available HERE.


One of the Congresswomen at the centre of racism row involving Trump says they will be a 'nightmare' to the president.US Representative Ilhan Omar says she will not be intimidated by President Donald Trump, who has attacked her with racist comments more than once this week, as she returned to a warm welcome in her home state of Minnesota."We are not deterred. We are not frightened," she told her supporters who held signs saying "End racism now" and "I stand with Ilhan"."We are ready," Omar said to cheers, before heading to a town hall on Medicare for All.On Wednesday, Trump renewed his attacks against four Congresswomen of colour, including Omar of Minnesota, at his first campaign rally in North Carolina since announcing his 2020 re-election bid."They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, 'Hey if you don't like it, let 'em leave, let 'em leave.'" He added, "I think in some cases they hate our country."Taking aim at Omar, he said: "She looks down with contempt on hard-working Americans saying ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country."The crowds, decked out in the colours of the US flag and "Make America Great Again" caps, responded with the chant - "Send her back! Send her back!"His criticism of Omar, which included a false accusation that she has voiced pride in al-Qaeda, received widespread criticism from politicians as well as people, with #IStandWithIlhan trending at number one in the US.Trump also claimed he had tried to stop the chant in North Carolina though video showed he let the chants continue as he took a long pause."I started speaking really quickly," he told reporters on Thursday. "I was not happy with it. I disagree with it" and "would certainly try" to stop any similar chant at a future rally.Earlier, a defiant Omar called the US president "fascist". She cast the confrontation as a fight over "what this country truly should be.""We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president because his policies are a nightmare to us," she told a cheering crowd that greeted her like a local hero at the Minneapolis St Paul International Airport.Trump started the week's tumult by tweeting on Sunday that Omar and three other Congresswomen could "go back" to their native countries if they were unhappy here.His other targets were Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.The four Congresswomen, known as "the squad", condemned Trump's racist tweets, saying they won't be silenced.In a rare vote earlier this week, the House of Representatives condemned Trump's racist weekend tweets against the four politicians. All four are US citizens and all but Omar were born in the US.Representative Ocasio-Cortez said on Thursday Trump's attacks on her and three other Democratic Congresswomen are putting millions of Americans at risk of physical harm.

			Trending:		PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — Want a Republican alternative to Donald Trump? Bill Weld is making his pitch.The former two-term governor of Massachusetts is decrying the state of affairs in Washington as he mounts a primary challenge against the president. Campaigning Thursday in the Granite State, Weld said Trump “thinks American citizens are his natural enemies.”“People try to claim he’s a really good counter-puncher in politics. He’s not a counter-puncher. He’s just vindictive by nature, and mostly against little people. He’s like bullies everywhere,” Weld said. “If nobody stands up to him, which is what we see with the Republican Party in Washington, D.C., he’s going to keep being a bully.“I would treat everybody with respect,” Weld added. “That doesn’t cost anything.”Weld spoke to about three dozen people at a Greater Derry Londonderry Chamber of Commerce event Thursday morning and a group double in size at a Portsmouth Rotary Club event that afternoon. While some voters said they found his message “refreshing,” they weren’t entirely sold on his ability to successfully challenge Trump.“He had some good things to say,” said Bill Simpson, an independent from Greenland, N.H. “I don’t think he has a chance in hell at the nomination.”Weld also lacks money, with just under $700,000 in total contributions. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $105 million in the second quarter.GOP strategist Ryan Williams said, “Bill Weld has no shot at winning.”“He obviously feels very strongly about President Trump and the direction he’s taking the party, and it’s a direction that’s at odds with Bill Weld’s idea of the party,” Williams said. “But winning or even making a dent in President Trump’s support — his campaign is completely insignificant in that regard.”Weld knocked the president’s attack on “the squad” of minority freshman congresswomen and chants of “Send her back” during Trump’s North Carolina campaign rally Wednesday night.“Last time it was, ‘Lock her up.’ Now it’s, ‘Send her back,’” Weld said. “It’s not worthy of the White House, really.”As Weld — the vice presidential nominee from the Libertarian Party in 2016 — looks to win New Hampshire’s Republican primary, he has a message for Democrats, too.“If you want to vote against Mr. Trump twice, come vote in the Republican primary for me, because that’s directly against Mr. Trump,” Weld said. “Then take a long hot shower with soap and go back to being a Democrat.”Portsmouth Democrat Susan Gold liked Weld’s idea for pulling a Republican primary ballot — but didn’t think she’d do it. Still, she enjoyed Weld’s “encouraging” message, saying “it sounds like a completely different party.”Sign up for email newsletters


A Georgia man could be facing criminal charges after he allegedly covered up bumper stickers on a woman's vehicle and then followed her several miles down the road.The incident reportedly happened on Monday when Sharon Wood, a Democrat, went grocery shopping at a Publix in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Wood told The Gwinett Daily Post that she returned to her car and discovered that two of her bumper stickers — one supporting Black Lives Matter and another supporting former Georgia state Representative Stacey Abram's 2018 gubernatorial bid — had been covered by 'I Love Trump' stickers.© 2019 Newsweek


The president of the European Council said Thursday he was happy to be in Canada where citizens don't say things like "Send him back" — a clear reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tweets that told ethnically diverse congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin rather than tell U.S. politicians how America should be governed."Dear Justin ... it is a pleasure to be in Montreal, the most European of Canadian cities. I really feel at home here, for many reasons, also because in Montreal I didn't hear anyone shouting, 'Send him back,'" Donald Tusk said at a press conference alongside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after a Canada-European Union summit.Tusk said he wasn't afraid to condemn Trump and his supporters despite the risk of offending the U.S. president and disrupting trading relations between America and the European bloc.I feel at home in Montreal for many reasons. Also because, I didn’t hear anyone shouting “SEND HIM BACK!”The quip came a day after a Trump rally in Greenville, N.C., where some of his followers chanted, "Send her back, send her back," after the president directed some of his attacks at Somalia-born Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who he has suggested should leave the U.S.Trump has accused Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of hating America and Israel. He has also accused her, without evidence, of being a sympathizer of al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization behind the Sept. 11 attacks.Tusk said while he didn't want to comment on the internal politics of the U.S. while standing alongside a Canadian leader, he said that the comments made by the president and his supporters were so deeply offensive he felt compelled to comment."I've been, for many years, one of the most pro-American politicians in Europe. It's difficult to understand some of those thoughts, words and sometimes if you feel that something is totally unacceptable you have to react despite business, despite interests. For me, values are much more important than trade, sorry, maybe I'm old fashioned but I will never change my opinion here," he said.Speaking to reporters in the White House on Thursday, Trump disavowed the "send her back" calls from the North Carolina crowd."I disagree with it. I felt a little bit badly about it," Trump said. "I was not happy about it. I disagreed with it but, again, I didn't say that, they did. I was not happy when I heard that chant."Trudeau again condemned Trump's racially charged rhetoric about Omar and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts."The comments made were hurtful, wrong and completely unacceptable. I want everyone in Canada to know that those comments are completely unacceptable and should not be allowed or encouraged in Canada," Trudeau said.Yesterday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also said there is no place in society for comments such as the ones Trump has made about the four Democratic congresswomen.Scheer said he believes people should be free to criticize their governments without having their backgrounds questioned or being told to leave the country.Trump defended himself in the face of criticism Thursday saying he started speaking quickly after the chant began in an effort to shut down the raucous crowd.However, video evidence of the rally shows otherwise; Trump stopped his speech and stood back from the podium for some 15 seconds as the cries grew louder.Watch Trump's reaction to the chants at his rally:Asked if he would stop his supporters from saying "send her back" at future rallies, Trump said, "I'd certainly try."Tusk, the former prime minister of Poland, said Trudeau is a valuable ally in the fight against xenophobic populism, an ideology he said threatens to undermine the foundations of Western society. He said he considers Trudeau to be "Europe's best friend.""In the unstable global setting we live in, it is reassuring the friendship between the EU and Canada is as stable as ever. Canada shares our vision of the world, our values and our objectives. We are both passionate believers in democracy, rule of law, human rights, solidarity among people and nations as well as rules-based international order," Tusk said.Parliamentary BureauJohn Paul (J.P.)

    CNN has announced the lineup for two nights of the Democratic presidential debate being held on July 30 and 31. The lineup was revealed during a drawing of names Thursday night.   The announcement comes one day after the Democratic National Committee announced the 20 presidential candidates who qualified the second debate. Candidates were split into three groupings for the live drawing to determine the lineup to help ensure candidates with different levels of support were evenly split across both nights. During the drawing, cards with the candidates' names were pulled from one box and then matched with a card from another second box with a debate date on it.More in 2020 Democratic primary debatesThe candidates' positions at the podium were then announced based on public polling.Former Sen. Mike Gravel, Mayor Wayne Messam, former Rep. Joe Sestak and Tom Steyer were the presidential candidates who did not make the second round of debates. Rep. Eric Swalwell, who was in the first debate in June, dropped out of the presidential race on July 8.

AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckThe president suggested that the Minnesota congresswoman might have married her brother, said she had blamed the United States for terrorist attacks and the crisis in Venezuela, and accused her of calling his supporters “ignorant” and disrespecting American troops. Here’s what she actually said. By Linda QiuPresident Trump’s attacks on Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, have been the centerpiece of his political strategy in recent days, a tactic that led his supporters at a raucous rally in North Carolina on Wednesday to erupt into chants of “send her back.” Ms. Omar is one of four Democratic members of Congress — all women of color — who have come in for intense criticism from Mr. Trump. His particular focus on Ms. Omar, who was born in Somalia and immigrated to the United States as a refugee, followed months of comments from him casting her as “ungrateful” and “unpatriotic.” On Wednesday, Mr. Trump drew attention to rumors that Ms. Omar had married her brother. The president then dove into a litany of accusations about the congresswoman. Some, like his repeated claims that Ms. Omar had praised Al Qaeda, were flatly false. Others, like his description of her citing a death toll in an infamous battle as “slander” against American troops, were his subjective characterizations of her remarks.Here’s a fact check. What Mr. Trump Said“Well, there is a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it.”— in remarks to reporters on WednesdayRumors that Ms. Omar had married her brother have been circulating since 2016, when she ran for state representative in Minnesota. No proof has emerged substantiating these claims.In 2016, Ms. Omar released a statement denying the rumors as “absolutely false and ridiculous” and providing a timeline of her marital history.According to that timeline, she applied for a marriage license with Ahmed Hirsi in 2002, but never finalized the application. In 2008, they ended their relationship “in our faith tradition.”State records show that in 2009, Ms. Omar legally married Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, who she said was a British citizen. They obtained a religious divorce in 2011, according to her timeline, and Mr. Elmi returned to England.She then reconciled with Mr. Hirsi and married him legally in January 2018, a month after she legally divorced from Mr. Elmi, according to The Associated Press. She and Mr. Hirsi have three children.Last month, Minnesota’s campaign finance board found that Ms. Omar filed joint tax returns in 2014 and 2015 with Mr. Hirsi while she was still legally married to Mr. Elmi. She agreed to pay a fine and back taxes as a result of the amendments to her returns those years.In 2016, a blog called PowerLine cited a now-deleted post on an internet forum that claimed Mr. Elmi is Ms. Omar’s brother. In 2018, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Ms. Omar showed a reporter cellphone images of documents from her family’s entry into the United States in 1995. They listed her father and siblings by order of birth, with Ms. Omar listed as the youngest of seven children. Mr. Elmi’s name did not appear in the documents. According to the couple’s marriage certificate, he is also three years younger than Ms. Omar, whose mother died when she was 2 years old. What Mr. Trump Said“So Representative Omar blamed the United States for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people’s affairs.”— at a rally in North Carolina on WednesdayMr. Trump was likely referring to comments Ms. Omar made in a 2013 interview with a local television program.“Nobody wants to face how the actions of the other people that are involved in the world have contributed to the rise of the radicalization and the rise of terrorist acts,” she said. Ms. Omar’s suggestion that there are links between foreign intervention and terrorism is not uncommon among scholars and world leaders and not unlike remarks from Mr. Trump himself.“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Mr. Trump said in an August 2016 speech in Ohio. “We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive.” What Mr. Trump Said“She smeared U.S. service members involved in Black Hawk Down, in other words, she slandered the brave Americans who were trying to keep peace in Somalia.”“Black Hawk Down” refers to a 17-hour firefight on Oct. 3, 1993, that broke out between American forces and Somali militiamen in Mogadishu during the country’s civil war. Ms. Omar and her family fled Somalia during that war.In 2017, Ms. Omar wrote, “thousands of Somalis killed by American forces that day!”Her figure is a matter of dispute, but whether her comment amounted to a “smear” or “slander” is a matter of opinion.American forces deployed to Somalia in 1992 as part of a humanitarian effort. Their mission culminated the next year when forces aligned with the warlord Muhammad Farah Aideed shot down two Black Hawk helicopters in a battle in which 18 Americans were killed and 75 wounded. The events were depicted in the book “Black Hawk Down” by the journalist Mark Bowden and a film of the same name.The army has cited estimates of between 500 and 1,700 Somali casualties. Mr. Bowden reported that most death toll estimates ranged from 300 to 500 Somalis. Robert Oakley, the ambassador to Somalia under President George Bush, said in a 1998 interview that he believed between 1,500 to 2,000 Somalis were killed and wounded.What Mr. Trump Said“She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization.”Ms. Omar wrote a letter to a federal judge asking for leniency in sentencing on behalf of nine Somali-American men, who were found guilty or pleaded guilty in 2016 to charges that they tried to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.“I bring to your attention the ramifications of sentencing young men who made a consequential mistake to decades in federal prison. Incarcerating 20-year-old men for 30 or 40 years, is essentially a life sentence,” Ms. Omar wrote in November 2016. “Such punitive measures not only lack efficacy they inevitability create an environment in which extremism can flourish, aligning with the presupposition of a terrorist recruitment: ‘Americans do not accept you and continue to trivialize your value. Instead of being a nobody, be a martyr.’”“The best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion,” the letter continued.What Mr. Trump Said“Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al Qaeda in a menacing tone and remarked that you don’t say America with this intensity, you say Al Qaeda. It makes you proud. Al Qaeda makes you proud. You don’t speak that way about America.”Mr. Trump distorted Ms. Omar’s remarks. In that 2013 local news interview, Ms. Omar was discussing the rhetoric around terrorism. When the host noted that “we keep the Arabic names” of terrorist groups, she responded with an anecdote about a college professor who would say the names with “intensity, so it must mean or bold a bigger meaning.” Nowhere in the interview does she say that “Al Qaeda makes you proud.” What Mr. Trump Said“And at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda … she refused to answer, she didn’t want to give an answer to that question.”Asked to respond to Mr. Trump’s false claims about her praising terrorists, Ms. Omar said she would not “dignify it with an answer.”She also added that she did not expect white community members to respond to questions about whether they “love” a white supremacist or a white man involved in a mass shooting, “so I think it is beyond time, it is beyond time to ask Muslims to condemn terrorists. We are no longer going to allow the dignification of such a ridiculous statement.”What Mr. Trump Said“Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela.”In May, she appeared on an episode of “Democracy Now!” after a segment featuring an economist who estimated that 40,000 Venezuelans died from 2017 to 2018 as a result of sanctions imposed by the United States. (Others have criticized those findings.)Ms. Omar agreed with the economist, adding, “A lot of the policies that we have put in place has kind of helped lead the devastation in Venezuela. And we’ve sort of set the stage for where we’re arriving today. This particular bullying and the use of sanctions to eventually intervene and make regime change really does not help the people of countries like Venezuela, and it certainly does not help and is not in the interest of the United States.”What Mr. Trump Said“And she looks down with contempt on the hard-working Americans, saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country.”In a May interview with a podcast from The Nation, Ms. Omar was asked about her experience being elected as a state representative in 2016 just days after Mr. Trump held a rally in Minnesota where he criticized the vetting process for Somali refugees and vowed to slow it down.John Nichols, the host of the podcast, commented that Ms. Omar might seize the “teaching moments” generated by the chasm between her personal story and Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.“I think people have a misconception about refugees and, and the process they go through to come to the United States,” Ms. Omar responded.As an example, she said, a Minnesota candidate for governor had vowed to stop the refugee resettlement program, prompting her to issue a Twitter post explaining how the process works.“And so it is not that they might not be knowledgeable about this, but they use it as a tool to stir up hate and division,” she continued. “And ignorance really is pervasive in many parts of, of this country. And as someone who was raised by educators, I really like to inform people about things that they might be ignorant to, willingly or unwillingly.”Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

‘Ruthlessly systematic’ research achieves qubit communication 200 times faster than ever before
Josh Taylor

Last modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 14.04 EDT

An Australian research team led by the renowned quantum physicist Prof Michelle Simmons has announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing, which researchers hope could lead to much greater computing power within a decade.Simmons, a former Australian of the Year, and her team at the University of New South Wales announced in a paper published in Nature journal on Thursday that they have been able to achieve the first two-qubit gate between atom qubits in silicon, allowing them to communicate with each other at a 200 times faster rate than previously achieved at 0.8 nanoseconds.A qubit is a quantum bit. In this design, it is built from single phosphorus atoms in silicon. In standard computing, a bit can exist in one of two states – 1 or 0. For qubits, it can be 1 or 0 or both simultaneously, which is referred to as a superposition.By being able to exist in both states simultaneously, the qubit can solve problems much faster than bits. This allows for much faster processing than current computers, meaning complex problems can be solved much more quickly.A two-qubit gate operates like a logic gate in traditional computing, and the team at UNSW was able to achieve the faster operation by putting the two atom qubits closer together than ever before – just 13 nanometres – and in real-time controllably observing and measuring their spin states.A scanning tunnelling microscope was used to place the atoms in silicon after the optimal distance between the two qubits had been worked out.The research has been two decades in the making, after researchers in Australia opted to build a quantum computer on silicon material.Simmons told Guardian Australia it was “quite a bold move” to try to build a quantum computer on silicon, but was starting to pay off.The research is still not as far ahead as Google or IBM, which have built 72-qubit and 50-qubit processors, respectively.Reducing the error rate, however, is key before quantum computing can reach scale and what is being heralded as “quantum supremacy” where quantum computing can solve what can’t be solved by computers today.In choosing silicon, Simmons said the research team had demonstrated that their atomic-scale circuitry has the lowest electrical noise of any system yet devised to connect to a semiconductor qubit.The next stage of research for the team will be to get to 10-qubit in the next five years, and hopefully within a decade to commercialising.Simmons said the work with the team of researchers at UNSW was “ruthlessly systematic” with no room for errors, but very rewarding.“We do like to have fun. I think that’s one of the key things: we work hard but we play hard.”


AdvertisementSupported byBy Patricia Mazzei and Frances RoblesSAN JUAN, P.R. — In the crushing days after Hurricane Maria, Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló declared in no uncertain terms, “Puerto Rico se levanta.” Puerto Rico rises.The call was meant as a rallying cry for recovery from the brutal hurricane that struck the island in 2017, a slogan of hope amid calamity.A year and a half later, Puerto Rico is rising in a different way — a popular uprising that has filled the cobblestone streets of colonial San Juan for nearly a week with tens of thousands of people and a unifying message: The governor must go.Ostensibly, the demonstrators were protesting the arrogant and crass exchanges by the governor and his inner circle in a leaked group chat and the corruption of top politicians unveiled by a series of high-profile arrests. But the forceful display amounted to a rejection of decades of scandals and mismanagement involving affluent and disconnected leaders who have time and again benefited at the expense of suffering Puerto Ricans.The outcry triggered by the chat, which included a string of contemptuous, sexist and homophobic conversations among Mr. Rosselló and his close associates, has brought the United States commonwealth to a crossroads, with far-reaching implications. For now, Mr. Rosselló  is still governor. But the persistent question about how Puerto Rico might be governed amid so many difficulties remains.Some of Mr. Rosselló’s ambitious goals, including the push for statehood, will almost certainly be shelved now. And his rapidly diminishing power has handed political fuel to President Trump, who on Thursday again derided the island’s leaders as not competent enough to manage federal disaster relief funds.“A lot of bad things are happening in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of Twitter posts. “I know the people of Puerto Rico well, and they are great. But much of their leadership is corrupt, & robbing the U.S. Government blind!”Mr. Trump claims to be vindicated even though some of Puerto Rico’s woes are not entirely of the island’s own making. Big Wall Street investors benefited for years from the Puerto Rican government’s willingness to keep taking on more debt. The island’s bankruptcy restructuring has cost jobs and, at one point, threatened public employees’ pensions and traditional Christmas bonuses.Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, a historian who retired last year from the University of Puerto Rico, said the protests against the governor are unprecedented. Nobody took to the streets during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, when both the local and federal governments were widely blamed for a botched response, because they were too busy surviving, she said. But the accumulation of grievances has led to a spontaneous explosion of discontent.“This has been a process of trauma,” Ms. Álvarez Curbelo said. “And so now, all of that trauma has come out, all of that pain.”Since Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published 889 pages of the leaked Telegram chat on Saturday, Mr. Rosselló has found himself increasingly isolated in office. The snowballing scandal has, suddenly and unexpectedly, united factions from across Puerto Rican society, revealing deep dissatisfaction with how the island is governed.The chat also mocked an overweight man, referred to a female politician as a “whore” and joked about the cadavers that had accumulated after Hurricane Maria in the understaffed morgue. Referring to Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan, who had signaled plans to run against Mr. Rosselló in 2020, the governor wrote, “She’s off her meds.”Luis Fortuño, a former governor who, like Mr. Rosselló, is a member of the New Progressive Party, said he did not see how Mr. Rosselló could continue in office. “The governor’s moral authority and credibility to lead are completely gone,” he said. “I only hope and pray that the governor will think of the Puerto Rican people first, and put them above his own political interests.” On Thursday, he called on Mr. Rosselló to resign.A protest Wednesday night saw tens of thousands of demonstrators again crowding the streets from the Capitol to the cobblestone streets of San Juan. On a platform with loudspeakers, the rapper Residente offered a microphone to the artist Ricky Martin. The trap musician Bad Bunny waved a flag. The singer iLe looked over the impressive crowd and declared, “It was about damn time to wake up.”Then the crowd — the schoolteachers and the union leaders, the lifelong political activists and the first-timers, the students and their parents — set off on foot to the governor’s mansion, where more protesters awaited. As during Monday’s protests, the night ended with chaotic confrontations with the police. Officers in riot gear used tear gas and rubber bullets. The young demonstrators left a Puerto Rican flag — symbolically painted in black, white and gray instead of red, white and blue — displayed on the ground facing the governor’s mansion.Mr. Rosselló reiterated on Thursday that he would not step down, despite being “fully aware” of the protests.“I recognize the enormous challenge that I have before me due to the recent controversies,” he said in a statement, “but I firmly believe that we can restore trust and, after this painful and shameful process, achieve reconciliation.”Mr. Rosselló’s tenure has been defined by the hurricane that hit less than nine months after his inauguration. Many people did not have electricity for months, and the storm is estimated to have left several thousand people dead — a grim reality that the governor’s administration was slow to acknowledge.Immediately after the storm, Mr. Rosselló’s administration caused outrage when it awarded a $300 million contract, to help restore power, to Whitefish Energy, a Montana company with no major disaster experience. After the public furor, the governor was forced to cancel the agreement. Mr. Rosselló and the electric company’s leaders were criticized for not having standard mutual aid agreements ready, so that outside utilities could be on hand to help quickly. In the end, it took nearly a year to get power fully restored.Mr. Rosselló has also overseen thousands of layoffs, cuts to public services, school closures and tuition hikes as a result of a 12-year economic recession and Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. Not all of those measures were Mr. Rosselló’s doing: The island’s finances are managed by an unpopular and unelected oversight board created by Congress.Mr. Rosselló has tried at times to push back against “la junta,” as the board is known, but his term has coincided with its oversight, and Puerto Ricans have fused their anger toward Mr. Rosselló with their anger toward the board. One of the most popular protest chants is, “¡Ricky, renuncia, y llévate a la junta!” — Ricky, resign, and take the board with you.Mr. Rosselló and the 11 other men on the leaked chat have been ordered to turn over their cellphones to Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice. The governor has maintained that there was no illegal activity taking place in the chat.The political crisis has prompted Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to consider imposing more oversight restrictions on $12 billion in federal Medicaid funds for the island. Tens of millions more have been set aside to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria.To avoid the unrest, cruise ships have skipped docking in San Juan, worrying small business owners who depend on tourists to survive. On Wednesday, Old San Juan felt eerily silent, its storefronts covered by storm shutters in advance of the angry crowds.Business leaders have expressed concern about scaring off investors long term, especially if truckers make good on their threat to join the protest by slowing deliveries of gasoline and goods.But Puerto Ricans of all stripes said they could no longer tolerate mocking, profanity and corruption, real or perceived, by the leaders who are supposed to be fighting on their behalf in Washington and San Juan. Six people with ties to the government, including a former Cabinet secretary and agency director, were arrested in the federal corruption investigation last week.At Wednesday night’s protests, some said it was the devastation of the hurricane, and the government’s poor response, that helped open people’s eyes.“This is the upside of Maria,” said Coralie Córdoba, 55. “This would not have happened, I don’t think, if we wouldn’t have had Maria. It’s been too many years of putting up and holding back.”Vanessa Ruiz, a 34-year-old teacher, said she was attending her first protest ever. Puerto Rico has had troubled governments “for as long as I remember, since I was a little girl,” she said.“I have never seen or heard of a transparent government,” she said. “I haven’t lived under a government that hasn’t been corrupt. This is why we came.”Puerto Rico has a long history of embarrassing scandals. Mr. Rossello’s father, Pedro J. Rosselló, who was governor from 1993 through 2000, saw some of his closest aides, including an executive assistant and the former secretary of education, convicted of kickback schemes. The stain on the two-time governor’s legacy added to his defeat when he tried to return to the governor’s seat in 2004.He lost to Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, who was later indicted in connection with an elaborate scheme to pay back campaign debt. A judge dismissed many of the charges, and a jury acquitted him of the rest. In 2015, a federal indictment laid out a pattern of cronyism surrounding former Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, whose brother was accused of accepting gifts from a top Popular Party fund-raiser.Mr. Acevedo said this week that members of his family joined this week’s protests. His daughter was tear gassed when police clashed with demonstrators. “I had never seen anything like this,” he said.Lawmakers have asked a panel of jurists to issue a recommendation on possible impeachment. Members of the governor’s New Progressive Party have spent much of the week on the phone, trying to figure out what comes next.“There is deep dissatisfaction, and there is grading of positions: Some people want him to resign the party presidency, some people want him to resign re-election aspirations and some are asking that he resign the position he currently holds,” said Kenneth McClintock, a former Puerto Rican secretary of state and senator.Mayor Mayita Meléndez of Ponce, who is a member of Mr. Rosselló’s party, left a meeting with the governor disgusted over his attempts to move on from the scandal.“I expected to see a sensible man, a repentant man,” she said. She has since called on him to resign.When he began campaigning, Mr. Rosselló, who holds a doctorate in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan but had no prior political experience, was viewed as an extension of his father. This week, his father called legislators on the island to plead his son’s case to stay in office.Carlos Romero Barceló, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985 and was one of the founders of the governor’s party 50 years ago, said he supported Mr. Rosselló’s candidacy but was surprised that once the governor took office, the governor’s chief of staff never returned any of Mr. Romero Barceló’s phone calls.“What has happened is the product of the arrogance and lack of experience,” Mr. Romero Barceló said.Still, Mr. Romero Barceló said it was “premature” to ask for the governor’s resignation. Party leaders were busy trying to find a good candidate to be secretary of state, so that someone could be in place for a smooth transition should Mr. Rosselló resign. The governor technically has the right to fill that position, but he needs the support of the head of the Puerto Rico Senate and House of Representatives to get a person approved.With his political life hanging in the balance, Mr. Rosselló turned earlier this week to the most mundane of government agencies to try to defend the work being done by his administration: The Department of Motor Vehicles, he touted, would soon provide more services online.Around the same time, on the other side of San Juan, several women walked into the local D.M.V. office and marched up to the framed portrait of the governor, with his boyish, matinee-idol good looks.In an age-old act of defiance against power, they unceremoniously yanked Mr. Rosselló’s picture off the wall.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect surname for a historian.

During a meeting in the Oval Office with a group of survivors of religious persecution, a Rohingya refugee enquired about US help: ‘I am a Rohingya from Bangladesh refugee camp. Most of the refugees are willing to go back home as soon as possible. So, what is the plan to help us?’. Donald Trump's response was: ‘Where is that exactly?’, to which Trump’s aide responded: ‘Bangladesh is right next to Burma.' Trump also had an awkward exchange with another of his guests, Nobel laureate and Iraqi Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad. When she requested aid for the Yazidis, Trump replied: ’And you had the Nobel prize? That’s incredible. They gave it to you for what reason?’ Source: YouTube/White House

Submerged sculptures and others that appear at low tide to be installed at several Queensland sites, as part of a project that also aims to rehabilitate sections of the reef

From a colour-changing figure warning of warming seas to a sunken skeletal greenhouse encrusted with coral, a new museum of underwater art in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef marine park aims to raise awareness of the threatened ecosystem – and rehabilitate parts of the reef.Created by British sculptor and environmentalist Jason deCaires Taylor, the Museum of Underwater Art (MOUA) will feature partially and fully submerged installations and sculptures that will become sites for coral and marine life regeneration.The artworks will be at several locations along the Queensland coast, including the John Brewer Reef, and Magnetic Island, Palm Island and Townsville. The first, Ocean Siren, due to open in December 2019, is on the Strand in Townsville. The solar-powered sculpture of a young indigenous girl will change colour as a visual warning of critical warming, using live water-temperature data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It will be exposed at low tide and underwater at high tide.“The Australian Institute of Marine Science has a series of temperature loggers around the reef. It will compile this data and feed it into the sculpture, so that changes in temperature will be seen in real time,” said deCaires Taylor.As with much of his previous work, deCaires Taylor hopes the museum will help to shape public debate and inform environmental policy.“Our oceans are going through rapid change, and there are huge threats, from rising sea temperatures to acidification, and a large amount of pollution entering the system,” he said. “Part of creating an underwater museum is about changing our value systems – thinking about the sea floor as something sacred, something that we should be protecting and not taking for granted.”Combining his skills as a sculptor, marine conservationist, underwater photographer and scuba-diving instructor, deCaires Taylor has been making underwater sculptures for over a decade. In 2006 he created the world’s first underwater sculpture park, in Grenada – the Molinere Underwater sculpture park and museum – and has since made sculpture parks around the world, including Cancún, Lanzarote and the Bahamas.Other installations as part of the new museum will include the large-scale Coral Greenhouse (at John Brewer Reef), expected to open shortly after Ocean Siren. This will be planted with more than 2,000 coral fragments from marine nurseries, to help it generate a marine ecosystem.“It will be installed just prior to coral spawning so will provide a new clean surface area for coral larvae to attach to,” said deCaires Taylor. “New species are being trialled including a range of temperature-resilient strains. The sculptures themselves are all made from a ph-neutral marine cement with a textured surface to help settlement. From past experience, works have begun to be colonised within a matter of days.”Plans for the Geoffrey Bay site on Magnetic Island include art telling the story of reef science, which should be completed by January 2021. Close to Palm Island, an installation is being created in consultation with the local indigenous community with the aim of increasing tourism to help bring a much-needed economic boost to the area. This site, in Coolgaree Bay, is due to open in August 2020, and is likely to be accessible only with official tour guides.“We spent 12 days with Jason surveying sites, looking for beautiful soft, sandy seabed where we can install the sculptures without doing any damage to the reef,” said Paul Marshall, chief environment officer at Reef Ecologic, one of the project partners. “We’ve also consulted with stakeholders, the community, businesses and government agencies, and spent time talking to indigenous communities, particularly those associated with Palm Island.”More than two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. The aim is for the new museum to be educationally relevant to scientists, locals and tourists.“We all care about the reef, but to have fantastic sculptures – representing the reef, representing people – is a reminder just how fragile [the reef] is, and how we’ve got to look after it and treat it like a museum,” said Adam Smith, managing director at Reef Ecologic.Previous deCaires Taylor projects have helped boost tourism around their locations and the new museum is expected to create jobs. The section of the reef close to Townsville currently sees fewer tourists than more northerly areas, near Cairns, where bleaching is more prevalent.The project’s collaborators have also considered the potentially negative consequences of an increase in tourism to the region, according to deCaires Taylor.“MOUA is looking at many operational models, from encouraging local visitors more than overseas ones, to electric power boats and providing stationary pontoons at the site to reduce the amount of travel needed,” he said.The new museum is a not-for-profit collaboration which has been in planning for two years. It is being funded by national and local government, and corporate partners including James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, in association with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.Last year, Coralarium, an intertidal installation created by deCaires Taylor at a hotel resort in the Maldives was demolished by authorities, after a court ruled that the human forms depicted in the work were anti-Islamic.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The pioneer of serious superheroes – who is retiring – has transformed the genre over 40 years of rebellious invention
Sam Thielman

One of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.A brainy pop writer whose style veers between Stephen King and John le Carré, Moore’s influence can be felt everywhere – in our literature, on our screens, in our politics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, quoted Watchmen’s Rorschach on Twitter, in response to reports that she was agitating the Democrats. (“I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.”) Writers as diverse as China Miéville and Ta-Nehisi Coates have cited him as inspiration. HBO’s great post-Game of Thrones hope is yet another adaptation of Moore’s most popular book, Watchmen, which (co-authored with illustrator Dave Gibbons) has sold millions of copies since it was first published in 1987. He’s played himself on The Simpsons, seen his work adapted into a number of films – none very good – and even inspired an activist collective: the Anonymous group wear Guy Fawkes masks as a tribute to V, the anarchist hero of Moore’s and illustrator David Lloyd’s V for Vendetta.This dystopian graphic novel continues to be relevant even 30 years after it ended. With its warnings against fascism, white supremacy and the horrors of a police state, V for Vendetta follows one woman and a revolutionary anarchist on a campaign to challenge and change the world. Moore's quintessential Superman story. Though it has not aged as well as some of his work, this comic is still one of the best Man of Steel stories ever written, and one of the most memorable comics in DC's canon.This introspective, stream-of-consciousness comic follows a successful ad man who begins to have a midlife crisis after realising the moral failings of his life and work.A love letter to the silver age of comics that nods to Buck Rogers and other classics of pulp fiction. Tom Strong embodies all of the ideals Moore holds for what a superhero should be.One of Moore's best known comic series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the ultimate in crossover works, drawing on characters from all across the literary world who are on a mission to save it. Moore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman’s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: “The lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.” And Moore’s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre – superheroes – widely considered to be devoid of them.He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad – each of these characters has moved me to tears.Moore can be tiresome – his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable – but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O’Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It’s quite moving.This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant; yet the books’ central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite – or perhaps because of – his plant-ness.Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs. Recently asked about the real-world political influence of V for Vendetta, he was characteristically blunt: “From my position, if I have had one of my ideas stolen from me and turned into yet another cash-generator for some abhuman corporation, then if it has at least escaped into the wild sufficiently to be of some symbolic use to today’s protest movements, that makes me feel a lot better about having written it in the first place.”At the heart of this antipathy is DC’s hold on the legal rights to his co-creations Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Moore and Gibbons were promised that all rights would return to them when Watchmen went out of print, but it never did. Gibbons accidentally predicted what would happen in this arrangement back in 1986. “What would be horrendous, and DC could legally do it, would be to have Rorschach crossing over with Batman or something like that, but I’ve got enough faith in them that I don’t think they’d do that,” he told Neil Gaiman in a public interview preserved by the Comics Journal. Moore never got his rights back and DC has spent many years revisiting Watchmen with lucrative anniversary editions, prequels, a movie, the forthcoming TV series and indeed Watchmen II, called Doomsday Clock, a work in progress with script and art by a different creative team. This will merge the fictional world Gibbons and Moore created with the universe shared by Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Moore’s efforts outside superheroics, such as From Hell, Lost Girls and A Small Killing, are often cited as proof of his literary worth. But his greatest contribution to English letters isn’t found in his additions to the growing canon of respectable graphic novels – a term Moore has said was invented to allow adults to “validate their continued love of Green Lantern or Spider-Man without appearing in some way emotionally subnormal”. It’s in his dazzling, quixotic overwriting, applied to trashy genre fiction with an ironic, but never cynical quality. This worked wonders on uncomplicated planet-tossers like Superman and Captain Marvel. And when he leaves behind the superhero hijinks, a lot of the fun leaves the writing along with them. Don’t get me wrong, the highbrow books are still brilliant; they’re simply not as enjoyable as the pulpy stuff.Many fans have been left in the awkward position of liking Moore’s superhero comics a good deal more than he does himself. When Miracleman delivers his baby girl and turns his face toward the reader, his eyes abrim with tears, and his internal monologue proclaims, “These are the moments when we are real”, I have always agreed, despite the narrator’s being clad in a blue leotard.Moore would be the first to tell you that seriousness isn’t always a virtue, but his was thoroughly transformative. And for many readers, myself among them, it was a great relief to be taken seriously as a reader of something supposedly sub-literate and stupid, to be treated with intelligence and care, and to be introduced to Moore’s rebellious brand of morality: his passionate feminism, his suspicion of authority and wealth, his love of normal people and veneration of togetherness, especially in the face of the hopelessness of the real world. His gifts for cruelty and horror inspired undistinguished competitors to enter the field, but his unexpected gentleness was what kept readers coming back to him.

The past four weeks have been calm, as far the Trump administration’s escalation of conflicts with foreign powers go. Since President Trump approved, then promptly cancelled, a strike on Iran on the evening of June 20 — military aircraft were in the air when Trump nixed the bombing, claiming it would have killed 150 people — it seemed the White House had forgotten about its simmering tensions in the Gulf, as it dealt with other crises.Alas, the break is over. On Thursday, just hours after an Iranian diplomat proposed a possible way to de-escalate the conflict, a Pentagon spokesman announced that a Navy vessel shot down a small Iranian drone that had come within 1,000 yards of an American amphibious assault ship in the Strait of Hormuz, a bottleneck off the coast of Iran through which 20 percent of the world’s oil is shipped. Trump said the drone’s encroachment was “the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, our facilities and interest and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran’s attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce.”Earlier in the day, at the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan, Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif discussed how the two nations could ease tensions, while addressing that Tehran would not back down from its missile program while the U.S. supplies its enemies in the gulf with similar weapons. As the New York Times explains:Mr. Zarif initially appeared determined to calm tensions with the United States. For the first time, he floated an opening bid of modest steps that Tehran would be willing to take as part of new talks between the two adversaries. The proposal would accelerate what the nuclear accord envisions as a “transition day,” now scheduled for 2023. That is when Iran formally ratifies an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to allow far more intrusive inspections of the country, including sites that Tehran has never declared as nuclear-related. In return, under the agreement, Congress would have to act to lift virtually all American sanctions on Iran.Upon learning of the drone, Zarif said that “we have no information about losing a drone.” He also downplayed a report from Iranian news media of the Revolutionary Guard detaining a small oil tanker that Tehran claims was smuggling fuel.Despite the pressure from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, Trump, in private, does not want an open conflict with Iran. “These people want to push us into a war, and it’s so disgusting,” Trump reportedly told a confidante in June, referring to his national security team. But sometimes he has a funny way of showing it.At least the Republican Party isn’t running with Trump’s rhetoricIt’s the kumbaya party nowLeaders of House Democratic factions riven by weeks of infighting pledged to unify on Thursday, with each side deleting recent social media posts attacking each other.In a joint statement issued Thursday, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.), New Democrat Coalition Chair Rep. Derek Kilmer (Wash.) and Blue Dog Coalition Chair Rep. Stephanie Murphy (Fla.) downplayed recent divisions over strategy and policy priorities.“House Democrats are a diverse, robust and passionate family. We love our country and are dedicated to making life better for everyday Americans. At times, there may be different perspectives on the way forward. That is a hallmark of the legislative process,” the joint statement reads. Good one, RandHow will Iran respond?Mayor Pete’s getting some help from HollywoodAmong the more than 50 celebrities who gave Buttigieg money during the second quarter are rocker Joan Jett ($150), recording industry mogul David Geffen ($5,600), fashion icon Anna Wintour ($2,800), designer Tom Ford ($5,600), actress Sharon Stone ($5,600) and comedian Ellen DeGeneres ($5,600).

Trump — who was previously referred to in court documents as “Individual 1” — has denied allegations of his involvement in the scheme.This is what the Mooch gets for not being completely reprehensibleThe Palm Beach County GOP disinvited Anthony Scaramucci from addressing its annual fundraising event after the short-lived White House communications director criticized President Trump’s “racially charged” tweets saying four members of Congress who are women of color should leave the United States.“He suggested the president’s comments were racist and that he was becoming a racist. Our board was infuriated,” said Michael A. Barnett, the Republican Party chairman in the county, home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago getaway.“We believe the tweets were not racist, the president is not racist and that Scaramucci’s comments were unfair,” Barnett, who is African American, said.“I am sorry that I was canceled,” he told POLITICO. “Mike Barnett must like and condone racist comments. Someone with more courage and less political expediency would call it for what it is and ask it to stop.”He actually stepped away from the microphone so they could chant more So why did he tweet “What a crowd, and what great people” after the rally?Booker makes it clear that his dispute with Biden isn’t overBooker was one of the first 2020 Democratic candidates to rebuke Biden’s comments [about segregationist colleagues], saying “he is wrong” to use the senators “as examples of how to bring our country together” and that Biden should apologize.Biden bristled at the comments, telling reporters, “Apologize for what? Cory should apologize.” He added, “He knows better. There’s not a racist bone in my body.”Biden later called Booker to smooth things over, but the tension was still evident on Thursday when Booker was asked at a Washington Post Live event whether he felt disrespected by Biden’s dismissal.“Of course I did,” Booker said. “How many times have we all in our lives, who are some kind of ‘other,’ dealt with mansplaining or dealt with condemning remarks?”Booker said the country needs a leader who is an “agent” of healing, reconciliation and truth-telling. He added that he was “stunned” it took Biden so long to apologize for championing the controversial 1994 crime bill, a measure fellow presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders also supported.

 Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  I’ve watched you check in for a flight and seen your doctor refilling a prescription.I’ve peeked inside corporate networks at reports on faulty rockets. If I wanted, I could’ve even opened a tax return you only shared with your accountant.I found your data because it’s for sale online. Even more terrifying: It’s happening because of software you probably installed yourself.My latest investigation into the secret life of our data is not a fire drill. Working with an independent security researcher, I found as many as 4 million people have been leaking personal and corporate secrets through Chrome and Firefox. Even a colleague in The Washington Post’s newsroom got caught up. When we told browser makers Google and Mozilla, they shut these leaks immediately — but we probably identified only a fraction of the problem.The root of this privacy train wreck is browser extensions. Also known as add-ons and plug-ins, they’re little programs used by nearly half of all desktop Web surfers to make browsing better, such as finding coupons or remembering passwords. People install them assuming that any software offered in a store run by Chrome or Firefox has got to be legit.Not. At. All. Some extensions have a side hustle in spying. From a privileged perch in your browser, they pass information about where you surf and what you view into a murky data economy. Think about everything you do in your browser at work and home — it’s a digital proxy for your brain. Now imagine those clicks beaming out of your computer to be harvested for marketers, data brokers or hackers.[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]Some extensions make surveillance sound like a sweet deal: This week, Amazon was offering people $10 to install its Assistant extension. In the fine print, Amazon said the extension collects your browsing history and what’s on the pages you view, though all that data stays inside the giant company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Academic researchers say there are thousands of extensions that gather browsing data — many with loose or downright deceptive data practices — lurking in the online stores of Google and even the more privacy-friendly Mozilla.The extensions we found selling your data show just how dangerous browser surveillance can be. What’s unusual about this leak is that we got to watch it taking place. This isn’t a theoretical privacy problem: Here’s exactly how millions of people’s data got grabbed and sold — and the failed safeguards from browser makers that let it happen.I didn’t realize the scale of the extension problem until I heard from Sam Jadali. He runs a website hosting business, and earlier this year found some of his clients’ data for sale online. Figuring out how that happened became a six-month obsession.Jadali found the data on a website called Nacho Analytics. Just one small player in the data economy, Nacho bills itself on its website as a marketing intelligence service. It offers data about what’s being clicked on at almost any website — including actual Web addresses — for as little as $49 per month.[Goodbye, Chrome: Google’s Web browser has become spy software]That data, Nacho claims, comes from people who opt in to being tracked, and it redacts personally identifiable information.The deeper Jadali looked on Nacho, the more he found that went way beyond marketing data. Web addresses — everything you see after the letters “http” — page titles and other browsing records might not seem like they’d expose much. But sometimes they contain secrets sites forget to hide away.Jadali found usernames, passwords and GPS coordinates, even though Nacho said it scrubs personal information from its data. “I started realizing this was a leak on a catastrophic scale,” Jadali told me.What he showed me made my jaw drop. Three examples:It wasn’t just personal secrets. Employees from more than 50 major corporations were exposing what they were working on (including top-secret stuff) in the titles of memos and project reports. There was even information about internal corporate networks and firewall codes. This should make IT security departments very nervous.Jadali documented his findings in a report titled “DataSpii,” and has spent the last two weeks disclosing the leaks to the companies he identified — many of which he thinks could do a better job keeping secrets out of at-risk browser data. I also contacted all the companies I name in this column. Kareo and Southwest told me they’re removing names from page data.[You downloaded FaceApp. Here’s what you’ve just done to your privacy.]I wondered if Jadali could find any data from inside The Washington Post. Shortly after I asked, Jadali asked me if I had a colleague named Nick Mourtoupalas. On Nacho, Jadali could see him clicking on our internal websites. Mourtoupalas had just viewed a page about the summer interns. Over months, he’d probably leaked much, much more.I called up Mourtoupalas, a newsroom copy aide. Pardon the interruption, I said, but your browser is leaking.“Oh, wow, oh, wow,” Mourtoupalas said. He hadn’t ever “opted in” to having his Web browsing tracked. “What have I done wrong?”I asked Mourtoupalas if he’d ever added anything to Chrome. He pulled up his extensions dashboard and found he’d installed 17 of them. “I didn’t download anything crazy or shady looking,” he said.One of them was called Hover Zoom. It markets itself in the Chrome Web Store and its website as a way to enlarge photos when you put your mouse over them. Mourtoupalas remembered learning about it on Reddit. Earlier this year, it had 800,000 users.When you install Hover Zoom, a message pops up saying it can “read and change your browsing history.” There’s little indication Hover Zoom is in the business of selling that data.I tried to reach all the contacts I could find for Hover Zoom’s makers. One person, Romain Vallet, told me he hadn’t been its owner for several years, but declined to say who was now. No one else replied.Jadali tested the links between extensions and Nacho by installing a bunch himself and watching to see if his data appeared for sale. We did some of these together, with me as a willing victim. After I installed an extension called PanelMeasurement, Jadali showed me how he could access private iPhone and Facebook photos I’d opened in Chrome, as well as a OneDrive document I had named “Geoff’s Private Document.” (To find the latter, all he had to do was search page titles on Nacho for “Geoff.”)In total, Jadali’s research identified six suspect Chrome and Firefox extensions with more than a few users: Hover Zoom, SpeakIt!, SuperZoom, SaveFrom.net Helper, FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement.They all state in either their terms of service, privacy policies or descriptions that they may collect data. But only two of them — FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement — explicitly highlight to users that they collect browser activity data and promise to reward people for surfing the Web.“If I’ve fallen in for using this extension, I know hundreds of thousands of other people easily have also,” Mourtoupalas told me. He’s now turned off all but three extensions, each from a well-known company.After we disclosed the leaks to browser makers, Google remotely deactivated seven extensions, and Mozilla did the same to two others (in addition to one it disabled in February). Together, they had tallied more than 4 million users. If you had any of them installed, they should no longer work.A firm called DDMR that made FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement told me the ban was unfair because it sought user consent. (It declined to say who its clients were, but said its terms prohibited customers from selling confidential information.) None of the other extension makers answered my questions about why they collected browsing data.A few days after the shutdown, Nacho posted a notice on its website that it had suffered a “permanent” data outage and would no longer take on new clients, or provide new data for existing ones.But that doesn’t mean this problem is over.North Carolina State University researchers recently tested how many of the 180,000 available Chrome extensions leak privacy-sensitive data. They found 3,800 such extensions — and the 10 most popular alone have more than 60 million users.“Not all of these companies are malicious, or doing this on purpose, but they have the ability to sell your data if they want,” said Alexandros Kapravelos, a computer science professor who worked on the study.Extension makers sometimes cash out by selling to companies that convert their popular extensions into data Hoovers. The 382 extensions Kapravelos suspects are in the data-sale business have nearly 8 million users. “There is no regulation that prevents them from doing this,” he said.[Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time]So why aren’t Google and Mozilla stopping it? Researchers have been calling out nefarious extensions for years, and the companies say they vet what’s in their stores. “We want Chrome extensions to be safe and privacy-preserving, and detecting policy violations is essential to that effort,” said Google senior director Margret Schmidt.But clearly it’s insufficient. Jadali found two extensions waited three to five weeks to begin leaking data, and he suspects they may have delayed to avoid detection.

 Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  As the nation remains embroiled in debates about the continued prevalence of white supremacy and our fraught race relations — something hammered home yet again with President Trump’s racist tweets about nonwhite Democratic members of Congress — nothing has been more central than deep disagreements over the meaning of Confederate symbols and their continued place in our society.The deep ties between those symbols and continued racial hatred make it stunning that one of the most vigorous defenders of Confederate symbols and the message of “Heritage, Not Hate” is an African American.Over the past 20 years, H.K. Edgerton — a onetime president of the Asheville branch of the NAACP — has become one of the most popular attractions in the Confederate heritage movement. At gatherings of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and United Daughters of the Confederacy, his performances vindicate the belief of white audiences that the Confederacy did not fight to preserve the institution of slavery and that thousands of enslaved men fought as soldiers in the Southern army.While both of these claims are false, Edgerton is not the first African American to perpetuate a distorted, celebratory history of the Confederacy. Like those before him, spreading such false stories may bring Edgerton personal fame, but they have dangerous consequences for African Americans pushing for racial equality more broadly.Slavery was the cornerstone of the Confederacy and its military. During the Civil War, many slaves were forced to accompany their masters into the army as body servants or camp slaves. Their presence on the battlefields and later at reunions reinforced the belief among white Southerners that slavery was benign and that slaves supported the Confederate cause. These men likely chose to take part in these reunions for their own self-interested reasons.The participation of former camp slaves in Confederate veterans’ reunions preserved a particular memory of the war that overlooked the actual desire of many slaves for freedom. It also reinforced political and racial orthodoxies — notably deference to white authorities — that had taken shape during the antebellum period and was being re-implemented by states as the Jim Crow era descended across the South.Former camp slaves participated in reunions often under the patronage of their one-time masters or the surviving members of the unit in which they served. Welcomed as “mascots,” a reference that reflected their subordinate status, these African American men secured their reputation by speaking out in favor of the Democratic Party or against the Republican Party. One former Virginia camp slave was described favorably as “entirely unreconstructed” — a shorthand way of stating that he never joined the Republican Party after the war and that he knew his place in society.Though segregated from white participants in dining, living and even in the public parades themselves, black participants could gain attention and resources by entertaining white crowds with harrowing wartime stories. For example, one elderly black man was welcomed into a private home after sharing how he had carried Stonewall Jackson’s body “to a place of safety” following the accidental shooting of the famed Confederate general at the battle of Chancellorsville. Entertaining white crowds with stories of rescuing famous generals like Jackson may have benefited elderly African Americans financially, at a time when many lived in poverty.The reality of race relations outside these reunion camps was quite different, however. African Americans in the South continued to push for civil rights in a much-weakened Republican Party and other political organizations. Whites countered black political action with disfranchisement and violence, most notably in the form of lynching. The second-class citizenship former slaves experienced at Confederate reunions reflected their place in a new system of white supremacy. And though these individuals escaped this violence, their participation in celebrating the Confederate legacy likely reinforced and justified the violent responses to the imagined specter of black violence that became a staple of the Jim Crow South.Some former camp slaves remained little more than a curious sideshow at reunions, but others went out of their way to embrace their roles as cooks and foragers, often reenacting them in a highly caricatured and even comical way for the large crowds. Jefferson Shields cultivated a colorful wartime backstory that placed himself in the camps of both Jackson and Gen. J.E.B. Stuart as a cook. Shields carried a live chicken under his arm at a reunion in Mobile, Ala., in 1910. “When asked what he was doing with the chicken,” noted a reporter, “he replied that he was just carrying his lunch.” Arguably, the best-known former camp slave and forager was Steve “Eberhart” Perry, who became a major attraction at Confederate reunions and other public events. He was easily singled out by his flamboyant dress, which included a tall, feathered stovepipe hat, live hens under each arm and a brightly colored sash embroidered with the words “ROME, GA.” U.S. and Confederate flags pins attached to his shoulder boards rounded out this unusual costume. He depicted the role of forager to remind veterans of the important role camp slaves played in securing what limited food was available to the army.But former camp slaves like Perry were also objects of ridicule — crowds were laughing at them, not with them — reinforcing the worst stereotypes of the happy slave, who enjoyed nothing more than entertaining white crowds. Audiences likely cared little for the history embodied in these costumes and instead viewed the men in such clothing as a spectacle, not unlike popular minstrel shows.So why would these African American men participate in a such a demeaning venture? The historical record offers little evidence to answer this question. Some certainly hoped to remain in the good graces of the white community or even profit financially as a result of their participation. Perry adopted the surname of his former master, “Eberhart,” specifically for these occasions, which suggests that he may have intentionally assumed a different persona as a way of maintaining his own dignity while assuming a subordinate role.Ultimately, the presence of former camp slaves at Confederate veterans’ events showed how powerful the social, economic and cultural legacy of slavery was in the post-Civil War era. Perry thanked his white benefactors following one reunion. “I shall ever remain in my place,” he reassured his fellow citizens, “and be obedient to all the white people. I pray that the angels may guard the homes of all Rome, and the light of God shine upon them.” Given this history, it’s unsurprising that Confederate heritage groups have embraced Edgerton today at a time when Confederate monuments are being removed or relocated. Edgerton’s appearance in uniform challenges the growing acceptance that the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments commemorate a cause that at its core was about the preservation of slavery and white supremacy.But not only is Edgerton peddling falsehoods refuted by countless historians of slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, but he’s also hurting himself and other African Americans by providing cover for white Southerners insisting upon continuing to venerate this fundamentally racist past instead of grappling with its harmful legacies. While racism in politics today — especially that coming from the White House — is preventing us from achieving racial equality in America, the continued myth that Confederates fought for something other than racism and oppression is an equally tall barrier to finally overcoming the darkest chapter of our past.

In June, Iran downed a US military drone in the area. Earlier, Tehran said it had seized a "foreign tanker" and its 12 crew on Sunday for smuggling fuel in the Gulf.Iran has been blamed by the US for attacks on tankers since May in the world's key shipping area. Tehran denies all the accusations.The recent incidents have triggered fears of a military conflict in the region.Speaking at the White House, he said: "I want to apprise everyone of an incident in the Strait of Hormuz today involving USS Boxer, a navy amphibious assault ship. "The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. "This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests."A defence department official quoted by the New York Times said the drone had been brought down using electronic jamming equipment.Washington earlier said Iran must immediately release the tanker it said it had seized.Iran's state media quoted Iran's Revolutionary Guards as saying the vessel had been smuggling one million litres (220,000 gallons) of fuel.The state media later published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker.The tanker was seized south of Iran's Larak Island, Iran said.Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened the sanctions that it reimposed on Iran's oil sector after unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied.Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran said the aircraft had violated Iranian airspace, and that the incident sent a "clear message to America".The US military said the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned what it called an "unprovoked attack".UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankers in the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.The UK said the tanker was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was en route there.US Central Command Chief General Kenneth McKenzie, speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, said he was working "aggressively" to find a solution to free passage for ships through the Gulf region, Reuters news agency reports.Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world

From a privileged perch in your browser, they pass information about where you surf and what you view into a murky data economy. Think about everything you do in your browser at work and home — it’s a digital proxy for your brain. Now imagine those clicks beaming out of your computer to be harvested for marketers, data brokers or hackers.[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]Some extensions make surveillance sound like a sweet deal: This week, Amazon was offering people $10 to install its Assistant extension. In the fine print, Amazon said the extension collects your browsing history and what’s on the pages you view, though all that data stays inside the giant company. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Academic researchers say there are thousands of extensions that gather browsing data — many with loose or downright deceptive data practices — lurking in the online stores of Google and even the more privacy-friendly Mozilla.The extensions we found selling your data show just how dangerous browser surveillance can be. What’s unusual about this leak is that we got to watch it taking place. This isn’t a theoretical privacy problem: Here’s exactly how millions of people’s data got grabbed and sold — and the failed safeguards from browser makers that let it happen.I didn’t realize the scale of the extension problem until I heard from Sam Jadali. He runs a website hosting business, and earlier this year found some of his clients’ data for sale online. Figuring out how that happened became a six-month obsession.Jadali found the data on a website called Nacho Analytics. Just one small player in the data economy, Nacho bills itself on its website as a marketing intelligence service. It offers data about what’s being clicked on at almost any website — including actual Web addresses — for as little as $49 per month.[Goodbye, Chrome: Google’s Web browser has become spy software]That data, Nacho claims, comes from people who opt in to being tracked, and it redacts personally identifiable information.The deeper Jadali looked on Nacho, the more he found that went way beyond marketing data. Web addresses — everything you see after the letters “http” — page titles and other browsing records might not seem like they’d expose much. But sometimes they contain secrets sites forget to hide away.Jadali found usernames, passwords and GPS coordinates, even though Nacho said it scrubs personal information from its data. “I started realizing this was a leak on a catastrophic scale,” Jadali told me.What he showed me made my jaw drop. Three examples:It wasn’t just personal secrets. Employees from more than 50 major corporations were exposing what they were working on (including top-secret stuff) in the titles of memos and project reports. There was even information about internal corporate networks and firewall codes. This should make IT security departments very nervous.Jadali documented his findings in a report titled “DataSpii,” and has spent the last two weeks disclosing the leaks to the companies he identified — many of which he thinks could do a better job keeping secrets out of at-risk browser data. I also contacted all the companies I name in this column. Kareo and Southwest told me they’re removing names from page data.[You downloaded FaceApp. Here’s what you’ve just done to your privacy.]I wondered if Jadali could find any data from inside The Washington Post. Shortly after I asked, Jadali asked me if I had a colleague named Nick Mourtoupalas. On Nacho, Jadali could see him clicking on our internal websites. Mourtoupalas had just viewed a page about the summer interns. Over months, he’d probably leaked much, much more.I called up Mourtoupalas, a newsroom copy aide. Pardon the interruption, I said, but your browser is leaking.“Oh, wow, oh, wow,” Mourtoupalas said. He hadn’t ever “opted in” to having his Web browsing tracked. “What have I done wrong?”I asked Mourtoupalas if he’d ever added anything to Chrome. He pulled up his extensions dashboard and found he’d installed 17 of them. “I didn’t download anything crazy or shady looking,” he said.One of them was called Hover Zoom. It markets itself in the Chrome Web Store and its website as a way to enlarge photos when you put your mouse over them. Mourtoupalas remembered learning about it on Reddit. Earlier this year, it had 800,000 users.When you install Hover Zoom, a message pops up saying it can “read and change your browsing history.” There’s little indication Hover Zoom is in the business of selling that data.I tried to reach all the contacts I could find for Hover Zoom’s makers. One person, Romain Vallet, told me he hadn’t been its owner for several years, but declined to say who was now. No one else replied.Jadali tested the links between extensions and Nacho by installing a bunch himself and watching to see if his data appeared for sale. We did some of these together, with me as a willing victim. After I installed an extension called PanelMeasurement, Jadali showed me how he could access private iPhone and Facebook photos I’d opened in Chrome, as well as a OneDrive document I had named “Geoff’s Private Document.” (To find the latter, all he had to do was search page titles on Nacho for “Geoff.”)In total, Jadali’s research identified six suspect Chrome and Firefox extensions with more than a few users: Hover Zoom, SpeakIt!, SuperZoom, SaveFrom.net Helper, FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement.They all state in either their terms of service, privacy policies or descriptions that they may collect data. But only two of them — FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement — explicitly highlight to users that they collect browser activity data and promise to reward people for surfing the Web.“If I’ve fallen in for using this extension, I know hundreds of thousands of other people easily have also,” Mourtoupalas told me. He’s now turned off all but three extensions, each from a well-known company.After we disclosed the leaks to browser makers, Google remotely deactivated seven extensions, and Mozilla did the same to two others (in addition to one it disabled in February). Together, they had tallied more than 4 million users. If you had any of them installed, they should no longer work.A firm called DDMR that made FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement told me the ban was unfair because it sought user consent. (It declined to say who its clients were, but said its terms prohibited customers from selling confidential information.) None of the other extension makers answered my questions about why they collected browsing data.A few days after the shutdown, Nacho posted a notice on its website that it had suffered a “permanent” data outage and would no longer take on new clients, or provide new data for existing ones.But that doesn’t mean this problem is over.North Carolina State University researchers recently tested how many of the 180,000 available Chrome extensions leak privacy-sensitive data. They found 3,800 such extensions — and the 10 most popular alone have more than 60 million users.“Not all of these companies are malicious, or doing this on purpose, but they have the ability to sell your data if they want,” said Alexandros Kapravelos, a computer science professor who worked on the study.Extension makers sometimes cash out by selling to companies that convert their popular extensions into data Hoovers. The 382 extensions Kapravelos suspects are in the data-sale business have nearly 8 million users. “There is no regulation that prevents them from doing this,” he said.[Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time]So why aren’t Google and Mozilla stopping it? Researchers have been calling out nefarious extensions for years, and the companies say they vet what’s in their stores. “We want Chrome extensions to be safe and privacy-preserving, and detecting policy violations is essential to that effort,” said Google senior director Margret Schmidt.But clearly it’s insufficient. Jadali found two extensions waited three to five weeks to begin leaking data, and he suspects they may have delayed to avoid detection. Google recently announced it would begin requiring extensions to minimize the data they access, among other technical changes. Mozilla said its recent focus has also been on limiting the damage add-ons can do.Just as big a problem is a data industry that’s grown cavalier about turning our lives into its raw material.In an interview, Nacho CEO Mike Roberts wouldn’t say where he sourced his data. But Jadali, he said, violated Nacho’s terms of service by looking at personal information. “No actual Nacho Analytics customer was looking at this stuff. The only people that saw any private information was you guys,” Roberts said.I’m not certain how he could know that.

Earlier this year, it had 800,000 users.When you install Hover Zoom, a message pops up saying it can “read and change your browsing history.” There’s little indication Hover Zoom is in the business of selling that data.I tried to reach all the contacts I could find for Hover Zoom’s makers. One person, Romain Vallet, told me he hadn’t been its owner for several years, but declined to say who was now. No one else replied.Jadali tested the links between extensions and Nacho by installing a bunch himself and watching to see if his data appeared for sale. We did some of these together, with me as a willing victim. After I installed an extension called PanelMeasurement, Jadali showed me how he could access private iPhone and Facebook photos I’d opened in Chrome, as well as a OneDrive document I had named “Geoff’s Private Document.” (To find the latter, all he had to do was search page titles on Nacho for “Geoff.”)In total, Jadali’s research identified six suspect Chrome and Firefox extensions with more than a few users: Hover Zoom, SpeakIt!, SuperZoom, SaveFrom.net Helper, FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement.They all state in either their terms of service, privacy policies or descriptions that they may collect data. But only two of them — FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement — explicitly highlight to users that they collect browser activity data and promise to reward people for surfing the Web.“If I’ve fallen in for using this extension, I know hundreds of thousands of other people easily have also,” Mourtoupalas told me. He’s now turned off all but three extensions, each from a well-known company.After we disclosed the leaks to browser makers, Google remotely deactivated seven extensions, and Mozilla did the same to two others (in addition to one it disabled in February). Together, they had tallied more than 4 million users. If you had any of them installed, they should no longer work.A firm called DDMR that made FairShare Unlock and PanelMeasurement told me the ban was unfair because it sought user consent. (It declined to say who its clients were, but said its terms prohibited customers from selling confidential information.) None of the other extension makers answered my questions about why they collected browsing data.A few days after the shutdown, Nacho posted a notice on its website that it had suffered a “permanent” data outage and would no longer take on new clients, or provide new data for existing ones.But that doesn’t mean this problem is over.North Carolina State University researchers recently tested how many of the 180,000 available Chrome extensions leak privacy-sensitive data. They found 3,800 such extensions — and the 10 most popular alone have more than 60 million users.“Not all of these companies are malicious, or doing this on purpose, but they have the ability to sell your data if they want,” said Alexandros Kapravelos, a computer science professor who worked on the study.Extension makers sometimes cash out by selling to companies that convert their popular extensions into data Hoovers. The 382 extensions Kapravelos suspects are in the data-sale business have nearly 8 million users. “There is no regulation that prevents them from doing this,” he said.[Alexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time]So why aren’t Google and Mozilla stopping it? Researchers have been calling out nefarious extensions for years, and the companies say they vet what’s in their stores. “We want Chrome extensions to be safe and privacy-preserving, and detecting policy violations is essential to that effort,” said Google senior director Margret Schmidt.But clearly it’s insufficient. Jadali found two extensions waited three to five weeks to begin leaking data, and he suspects they may have delayed to avoid detection. Google recently announced it would begin requiring extensions to minimize the data they access, among other technical changes. Mozilla said its recent focus has also been on limiting the damage add-ons can do.Just as big a problem is a data industry that’s grown cavalier about turning our lives into its raw material.In an interview, Nacho CEO Mike Roberts wouldn’t say where he sourced his data. But Jadali, he said, violated Nacho’s terms of service by looking at personal information. “No actual Nacho Analytics customer was looking at this stuff. The only people that saw any private information was you guys,” Roberts said.I’m not certain how he could know that. There were so many secrets on Nacho that tracking down all the ways they might have been used is impossible.[It’s the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]His defense of Nacho boiled down to this: It’s just the way the Internet works.Roberts said he believed the people who contributed data to Nacho — including my colleague — were “informed.” He added: “I guess it wouldn’t surprise me if some people aren’t aware of what every tool or website does with their data.”Nacho is not so different, he said, from others in his industry. “The difference is that I wanted to level the playing field and put the same power into the hands of marketers and entrepreneurs — and that created a lot more transparency,” he said. “In a way, that transparency can be like looking into a black mirror.”He’s not entirely wrong. Large swaths of the tech industry treat tracking as an acceptable way to make money, whether most of us realize what’s really going on. Amazon will give you a $10 coupon for it. Google tracks your searches, and even your activity in Chrome, to build out a lucrative dossier on you. Facebook does the same with your activity in its apps, and off.Of course, those companies don’t usually leave your personal information hanging out on the open Internet for sale. But just because it’s hidden doesn’t make it any less scary.Read more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

In June, Iran downed a US military drone in the area. Earlier, Tehran said it had seized a "foreign tanker" and its 12 crew on Sunday for smuggling fuel in the Gulf.Iran has been blamed by the US for attacks on tankers since May in the world's key shipping area. Tehran denies all the accusations.The recent incidents have triggered fears of a military conflict in the region.Speaking at the White House, he said: "I want to apprise everyone of an incident in the Strait of Hormuz today involving USS Boxer, a navy amphibious assault ship. "The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. "This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests."A defence department official quoted by the New York Times said the drone had been brought down using electronic jamming equipment.Washington earlier said Iran must immediately release the tanker it said it had seized.Iran's state media quoted Iran's Revolutionary Guards as saying the vessel had been smuggling one million litres (220,000 gallons) of fuel.The state media later published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker.The tanker was seized south of Iran's Larak Island, Iran said.Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened the sanctions that it reimposed on Iran's oil sector after unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied.Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran said the aircraft had violated Iranian airspace, and that the incident sent a "clear message to America".The US military said the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned what it called an "unprovoked attack".UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankers in the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.The UK said the tanker was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was en route there.US Central Command Chief General Kenneth McKenzie, speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, said he was working "aggressively" to find a solution to free passage for ships through the Gulf region, Reuters news agency reports.Soldiers, teachers and police officers are reportedly getting their biggest rise in six years.'I’d never held hands, kissed or hugged anyone'Sign up for our newsletter

Abu Dhabi and Riyadh pledged $500m each but have so far failed to pay up as humanitarian disaster worsens.United Nations - Yemenis are dying from cholera, hunger and other ills because Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are not making good on funding pledges they made earlier this year, a top United Nations official warned on Thursday.Mark Lowcock, the UN's emergency relief coordinator and under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council while most of the 40 countries that made pledges in February had stumped up aid cash, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh were holding out."Those who made the largest pledges - Yemen's neighbours in the coalition - have so far paid only a modest proportion of what they promised," said Lowcock, referring to the coalition of the UAE, Saudi and others fighting in Yemen.Governments promised a combined $2.6bn in February, including $500m each from mega-donors Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. Without that cash from the Gulf powers, the "response plan is currently just 34 percent funded", said Lowcock.Cash shortfalls have left UN-backed aid teams unable to carry out vital work in Yemen, where fighting has forced millions from their homes and left 24.1 million - more than two-thirds of the population - in need of aid, said Lowcock.Abdallah al-Mouallimi, Saudi's UN ambassador, said his country had paid more than $400m to the United Nations and other aid organisations this year."This year we alone ... we have paid more money into Yemen than any of the donors in the world," Mouallimi told reporters.Cutbacks have seen disruption at medical facilities serving nine million Yemenis, while aid workers have been forced to suspend vaccinations for 13 million people, including 200,000 youngsters, Lowcock said.Work on 30 new feeding centres in the most famine-stricken parts of Yemen has ground to a halt, and as many as 60 centres could shut their doors in the coming weeks, risking the lives of some 7,000 malnourished children, he added. "In [the capital] Sanaa, a UN-supported treatment plant that purifies water for agriculture has also started to shut down," said Lowcock."This means up to four million people could soon be eating vegetables irrigated with dirty water, making them more likely to contract cholera."Yemen could be slipping back into what many experts called the "world's worst-ever cholera epidemic", said Lowcock. Nearly 500,000 cholera cases have been reported already this year, a big increase from the 380,000 cases reported during all of 2018 and an indication the infectious bug was spreading again."The death toll will surely grow," added Lowcock. The Saudi and Emirati missions to the UN in New York City did not immediately reply to Al Jazeera's request for comment. Both countries say they work hard to ease the humanitarian crisis in a country in which they are involved militarily.Britain's ambassador to the world body, Karen Pierce, said "simply not enough" cash had been handed over so far and urged "donors to rapidly disburse their funds to the UN-led appeal". "There is a risk of this escalating and that we take two steps forward and three back," said Pierce. "The risk of the cholera returning is horrific and we need to do everything we can to stop that."Tens of thousands of people have been killed since the Saudi-UAE-led military coalition intervened against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and in support of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government in March 2015.The conflict in Yemen broke out in late 2014 when Houthis seized much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa. The war is widely seen as a proxy battle between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Security with SamSam JadaliSecurityWithSam.comWe present DataSpii (pronounced data-spy), the catastrophic data leak that occurs when any one of eight browser extensions collects browsing activity data — including personally identifiable information (PII) and corporate information (CI) — from unwitting Chrome and Firefox users. Our investigation uncovered an online service selling the collected browsing activity data to its subscription members in near real-time. In this report, we delineate the sensitive data source types relevant to the security of individuals and businesses across the globe. We observed two extensions employing dilatory tactics — an effective maneuver for eluding detection — to collect the data. We identified the collection of sensitive data from the internal network environments of Fortune 500 companies. Several Fortune 500 companies provided an additional measure of confirmation through a process of responsible disclosure. By deploying a honeypot to monitor web traffic, we discovered near-immediate visits to URLs collected by the extensions. To address the evolving threat to data security, we propose preemptive measures such as limiting access to shareable links, and removing PII and CI from metadata.Imagine if someone could publicly access, in near real-time — within an hour — your sensitive personal data on the websites you are browsing. Imagine, further, this person could access your sensitive business data in much the same way. Moreover, what if you and/or your colleagues were, yourselves, unwittingly leaking such data? In Table 1 below, we enumerate the types of data that can be accessed.Table 1. Types of personal and corporate data accessible via the online service.This scenario may seem far-fetched, but in reality, it has global implications for millions of people across the globe who unwittingly send information about their browsing activity to a publicly accessible online service via at least eight browser extensions. The online service, referred to in this report as Company X, then provides the collected data to its paid or free-trial members who request such data about any domain of their choosing. See Table 2 for the Chrome and Firefox browser extensions in question.**The eight extensions state in either their terms of service, privacy policies, or descriptions that they may collect data that is personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable. While such statements appear to provide transparency about their data collection, privacy policies are largely ignored by web users [1].Table 2. Chrome and Firefox extensions identified in the DataSpii leak.†The invasive data collecting behavior occurs when the SaveFrom.net Helper extension is installed from the author’s official website using Firefox on macOS or Ubuntu. We have not observed such invasive behavior when it is installed from a browser vendor store.‡FairShare Unlock, PanelMeasurement, Branded Surveys, and Panel Community Surveys make explicit efforts to let their users know they collect browser activity data.These browser extensions and their respective browsers (i.e., Chrome or Firefox) run on desktops and laptops with macOS, Windows, Chrome OS, or Ubuntu operating systems. The extensions also run on Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Opera, Yandex Browser) that accept Google Chrome extensions. Google Chrome Sync’s feature, for instance, can spread the extensions to home and work computers. The extensions collect highly sensitive user information from URLs, page titles, and referrers. The collected data is then filtered by domain name and offered for sale. In one instance, we observed the widespread exposure of corporate project data and employee tasks from thousands of companies that use a popular project management provider, atlassian.net. It is important to note that this report examines data obtained from Company X; it does not address whether other companies or individuals may have also disseminated such data.As stated above, the term Company X shall refer to the online service selling analytics data of any website. To protect the data of the millions of users and businesses impacted by DataSpii, this report has omitted the name of the online service. The term Party Y shall refer to the data collector vis-à-vis the eight browser extensions at the center of this report. For convenience, Party Y also refers to one or more corporate entities that may or may not have legal relationships with each other. Party Y shall also refer to other browser extensions, as yet unidentified, involved in the collection, processing, and/or dissemination of data.During the course of our investigation, we observed Party Y extensions collecting browser activity data. Within one hour of collection, we observed that same data being disseminated to members of Company X. (Company X does not provide all Party Y collected metadata types [e.g., last-modified] available to its customers.) Once signed up for Company X’s free trial, a member can then view the near real-time traffic data of any organization by merely entering its domain name (see Figure 1). The data is then filtered by domain name and delivered to the Google Analytics accounts of Company X members. The collected metadata delivered to Company X members includes hostname, URL, page title, referrer, browser, browser version, city, state, country, internet service provider (ISP), network domain, operating system (OS), OS version, date, and time. The Google Analytics service collates the metadata, thus providing Company X members with insight into the sources of a domain’s web traffic statistics.<img class="wp-image-55" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14.png 1580w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14-295x300.png 295w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14-768x781.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14-1007x1024.png 1007w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-14-1568x1594.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1580px) 100vw, 1580px" />Figure 1. Possible scenario for how one impacted individual, Jerry, can leak the data of many of his clients. Tax returns are among the types of data made accessible via DataSpii.A browser is software (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer) that enables users to search, access, and display web pages. Browsers provide an interface to perform various web activities such as emailing, cloud-sharing, online shopping, watching movies, listening to music, and sharing photos. Browser extensions are modules that enhance and customize the browsing experience. For example, ad blockers are extensions that increase page speeds and reduce browser crashes, whereas password managers are extensions that generate and store random passwords, thereby increasing overall security.According to the Google Chrome Developer site, “Extensions are event based programs used to modify or enhance the Chrome browsing experience. Events are browser triggers, such as navigating to a new page, removing a bookmark, or closing a tab. Extensions monitor these events in their background script, then react with specified instructions” [2]. Such triggers allow an extension to send user browsing data to third-party servers, which in turn can be used to compile user profiles for (the purpose of) targeting users with personalized advertisements.In Data and Goliath, Bruce Schneier notes that some corporations use surveillance data to target consumers with discounts, trial offers, and other promotional features [3]. Corporations and governments that exchange surveillance data for legitimate purposes may also be sharing it — albeit inadvertently — with cybercriminals, often in huge data breaches. While most users understand that browsing activity is surveilled and tailored for advertisement purposes, few appreciate the full implications of being monitored.Likewise, browser extensions surveil user data in return for convenience. Antimalware extensions warn users of danger by collecting the URLs that users visit and cross-referencing those URLs with a live database of known hacked sites. Grammar check extensions collect user-entered text, including social media posts, documents, and emails. In exchange for such conveniences, users are bombarded with personalized insights, performance stats, or advertisements. When such data is collected for tailored advertisements, market research, or enhanced browsing experiences, it may inadvertently end up in the wrong hands. Thus, the very same data that enhances personal experiences jeopardizes personal, corporate, and government information.Company X’s frequently asked questions (FAQ) page maintains that millions of people around the world opted in to anonymously share their browsing history. It further maintains that what it is doing is legal, ethical, and patented. While Company X does not disclose its method of data collection, it does seek to assure its users that the data collected remains anonymized. We suggest that this is not always the case. Moreover, if an employee is using a data-collecting browser extension on a company computer, the employee may not have the authority to consent on behalf of his or her employer.While our investigation did not establish a legal relationship between Party Y and Company X, it did establish that much of the data collected by Party Y was made available to members of Company X.The privacy policies of the Party Y extensions inform the end user that data may be collected. While privacy policies may allay some concerns about data collection, they are largely ignored by the typical web user [1]. Furthermore, in this report, we elucidate a delayed data collection measure employed by two Party Y extensions.While Party Y extension policies state they may employ “PII scrubbers” to assist in providing anonymity, this report details their inability to scrub all types of PII. As a matter of legality, the European Union’s recently enacted data privacy law (EU-GDPR) states that the PII of all EU data subjects must be redacted or pseudonymized [4]. The failure to redact sensitive information, including PII and CI, endangers everyone who uses Party Y extensions, either directly or by association.After our reporting of a Party Y extension to a browser vendor, the vendor remotely disabled the extension for all users; however, that did not stop the data collection in our browser. While the extension ceased its functionality, we continued to observe our browsing activity being sent via POST request to Party Y servers. Ultimately, the data collection stopped when we removed the extension.DataSpii circumvented the most effective security measures including authentication or encryption, which were designed to thwart leaks. Using a multi-pronged approach, we discovered the collection of sensitive data from the private LAN networks of many Fortune 500 companies. In addition, we devised a LAN experiment and observed the collection of hyperlinks stored within the page content of the website hosted on our LAN. Such data collected from a single visit to a page in a LAN environment can be used to map a corporation’s LAN environment. Furthermore, we observed the dissemination of our LAN data to three different hostnames. The collected data included our site’s LAN IP address, hostname, page title, timestamp of the visit, as well as the URLs of page resources (i.e., CSS files, JS files, and images) referenced in our HTML code. We then observed much of our LAN data being disseminated to members of Company X. Finally, through the responsible disclosure process, we corroborated our discovery with impacted individuals and major corporations.Cybersecurity companies have long warned about the dangers of publicly accessible links [5]. In addition, the HTTP referer header has been notoriously known to cause leakage of publicly accessible URLs. Researchers have also warned about the data collection practices of browser extensions. Unfortunately, many corporations often fail to act on this direct knowledge. The problem is compounded when an online service such as Company X publishes the near real-time traffic data for its members. The dissemination of such data by Company X undermines the data protection features of data source types such as ephemeral links, URL-based query string authentication parameters, and API keys.Extensions have access to powerful browser application interface (API) functions that tap into user browsing activity. While some extensions may use this data to perform their inherent, legitimate functions, others use the data strictly for monetization or advertising. In order to be approved by a browser extension store, an extension must be reviewed by browser vendors; however, perfunctory reviews can result in the approval of bad actors. We identify seven data source types and provide examples of impacted companies by each.Note: We have made disclosures to all impacted companies listed in this report. We have not identified any data being used maliciously. However, through our honeypot experiment, we observed third parties visiting unique URLs captured by Party Y browser extensions.Web users frequently share publicly accessible unique links with family, friends, and colleagues. The links can direct recipients to Apple iCloud photos, Quickbooks invoices, 23andMe ancestry data, Nest security camera video clips, or confidential documents stored on OneDrive. The following examples detail how the leaking of shared links can impact major online services.The DataSpii leak enables malicious parties to monitor corporate or client meetings. Enterprise businesses use services like Zoom for online meetings, video conferencing, and webinars. Typically, the meeting organizer will invite colleagues or clients by sharing a Zoom meeting link via email. The invite link URL often contains a unique meeting ID. When a participant of the meeting opens the link using a browser with an invasive extension, the link URL may then be displayed to a Company X customer in near real-time (see Figure 2).Features of Zoom’s “Business” plan enable customers to choose a vanity hostname such as example.zoom.us. The vanity hostname acts as an easy way to brand the Zoom account and is included as a subdomain of the link URLs used for the organization’s online meetings. Search refinement tools provided by Google Analytics make it easy for a Company X member to filter the subdomains of Zoom customers, thereby allowing that member to filter meetings specific to an organization. Meetings that are not password protected become vulnerable to eavesdropping by outsiders with access to the URL. Although Zoom notifies meeting participants when a new user joins a meeting, it is possible for these notifications to be disregarded, especially during meetings with large numbers of participants. Zoom also offers a popular “waiting room” feature, enabling the host to manually admit each participant to ensure only their intended participants join their meeting.<img id="figure" class="wp-image-56" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15.png 1538w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15-150x150.png 150w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15-298x300.png 298w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15-768x774.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-15-1016x1024.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 1538px) 100vw, 1538px" />Figure 2. Zoom.us meeting URLs.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.As with Zoom, Skype users ask their friends or colleagues to join a group chat using a publicly accessible shared link. The recipient of the link can join the chat directly from a web browser. When a user opens the link with a Party Y browser extension, the Skype group URL may become available to Company X customers who request the data of Skype.com (see Figure 3). A malicious Company X member may use the link to eavesdrop on chat conversations. Note that when a new user joins the group chat, Skype will notify connected users that a new guest has joined the conversation.<img class="wp-image-57" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-16.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-16.png 1190w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-16-300x287.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-16-768x736.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-16-1024x981.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px" />Figure 3. Skype group chat URLs.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.23andMe customers can share reports with family, friends, and/or their entire social network using a publicly accessible link. When the link is opened by a user with a Party Y browser extension, the URL of the report becomes available to any Company X customer that requests data on 23andme.com. Figure 4 displays URLs matching a known format for publicly accessible 23andMe reports. Such reports may include information on ancestry, family DNA, muscle composition, and other biomedical data. <img class="wp-image-58" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17.png 2210w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17-300x228.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17-768x585.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17-1024x779.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-17-1568x1193.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2210px) 100vw, 2210px" />Figure 4. Redacted links to shared 23andMe DNA and ancestry reports.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.When an iOS user stores photos on iCloud and shares four or more photos via the Photos app, the app will generate a publicly accessible unique link to the photos. When a recipient or sender opens the link in a browser with a Party Y extension, the link to the photos is collected. Such a link may end up in the hands of a Company X member requesting the data of icloud.com (see Figure 5). When the URL is visited, the photos become visible and may even display an iOS user’s first and last name.<img class="wp-image-59" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-18.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-18.png 926w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-18-300x238.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-18-768x610.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" />Figure 5.

While Apple may well omit PII from visible areas of the order status page, during our observations, it did not conceal PII within the source code of our own Apple order. This source code can easily be viewed in web browsers by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting the “view page source” option.

Such invoices may be accessible via a publicly accessible unique link (see Figure 8). When the links are viewed using a browser with a Party Y extension, they may be delivered to customers of Company X that request data of intuit.com. Viewing the invoice may reveal the recipient’s full name, address, city, state, zip code, amount paid, invoice number, date, and details of the service, as well as the name and address of the vendor who sent the invoice.<img class="wp-image-62" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-21.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-21.png 1558w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-21-300x289.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-21-768x740.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-21-1024x987.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1558px) 100vw, 1558px" />Figure 8.

Nest members can share surveillance videos with others using a publicly accessible unique link. If the sender or recipient of a shared video clip accesses the URL via a browser with a Party Y extension, the link to the clip may then become available through the Company X service (see Figure 9).<img class="wp-image-63" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22.png 1824w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22-300x132.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22-768x337.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22-1024x449.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-22-1568x688.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1824px) 100vw, 1824px" />Figure 9.

Developers can access their code via a publicly accessible unique URL. If the senders or recipients visit a JSFiddle.net URL using a browser with a Party Y extension, the code may appear to members of Company X requesting data on jsfiddle.net. In addition, Google Analytics tools allow Company X members to filter URLs by a visitor’s service provider. Google Analytics defines the service provider dimension as the internet service provider (ISP) registered to the IP address of the visitor. Many of the largest corporations operate as their own ISP. In Figure 10, we filter the service provider dimension for some of the largest organizations, and observe visits to JSFiddle.net URLs from those networks. The data obtained from Company X could then be used by bad actors to view or scrape the contents of JSFiddle URLs visited by targeted corporations.<img class="wp-image-64" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-23.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-23.png 1310w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-23-215x300.png 215w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-23-768x1073.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-23-733x1024.png 733w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" />Figure 10. Redacted JSFiddle.net URLs filtered by service provider dimension (ISP).Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.Insecure practices such as embedding PII in the URL still occurs within many organizations. When browser users with a Party Y extension visit pages with PII in the URL, the data can be viewed by Company X members. A cybercriminal can use such data to find a person’s GPS coordinates in near real-time, commit burglary during a homeowner’s absence, or to stalk travelers along their destinations.Southwest.com, United.com, and AA.com (American) all include passenger last names and record locator (confirmation) numbers within the URL. In addition, Southwest.com URLs may also include a passenger’s first name. On February 6, 2019, Wandera’s threat research team reported that many airlines, including Southwest Airlines, expose PII in their URLs. During our investigation in early June of 2019, Company X data showed thousands of Southwest URLs containing passenger first names, last names, and record locator numbers within the URL (see Figure 11). Note: After disclosure, Southwest confirmed they are aware of this issue and have enhancements underway.<img class="wp-image-65" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24.png 2054w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24-300x179.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24-768x458.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24-1024x611.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-24-1568x936.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2054px) 100vw, 2054px" />Figure 11.

Such email addresses can be cross-referenced with hacked databases located on the dark web to exploit vulnerable Apple users.<img class="wp-image-67" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-26.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-26.png 1310w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-26-235x300.png 235w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-26-768x979.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-26-803x1024.png 803w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" />Figure 13. iforgot.apple.com page URLs containing email addresses.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.To protect corporate assets, security-conscious businesses enforce user authentication to access company documents and portals; however, such businesses may ignore the content of data stored within the page title, which may contain descriptive confidential information. For example, “Firewall needs to be re-enabled. All ports are currently open” or “reset VPN password to [REDACTED-PASSWORD].” The near real-time exposure of such information creates opportunities for cybercriminals to attack individuals or organizations.Atlassian is an enterprise software company that provides project management and document collaboration software to its clients. Atlassian’s project management software, JIRA, inserts project issues and employee-assigned tasks into the page title. Atlassian customers have the option to self-host Atlassian software or use the Atlassian Cloud platform. Companies that choose the Atlassian Cloud option can host their project management portal on a subdomain of atlassian.net (i.e., example.atlassian.net) [6]. When a Company X member requests data for atlassian.net, the data includes all subdomains under the domain. Within two hours of requesting Atlassian.net data via the Company X service, we observed the collection of 30,000 unique URLs on more than 1,400 atlassian.net subdomains. This included page title data from the following atlassian.net subdomains: BuzzFeed, NBCdigital, AlienVault, CardinalHealth, TMobile, Reddit, and UnderArmour. Users of these subdomains may have a Party Y extension leaking corporate page title and URL data, as shown in the following examples.Example: nbcdigital.atlassian.net page titles include:“Technical failure for <5 minute period of time affecting public save submissions or technical issues before Save period starts that cannot be resolved before the Save period opens – [REDACTED] – Confluence”“Wrong contestant name(s) and/or image(s) displaying online, in the viz, or in the official app”Example page title from an unnamed automotive company:“Whitelist IP [RED.ACT.ED.IP] and [RED.ACT.ED.IP] for all AWS servers.”From such information, a cybercriminal would know that the two IP addresses or server(s) have unfettered access to the entire company’s AWS servers. The cybercriminal can use such knowledge to focus all of his or her efforts on breaking into the server(s) associated with those IPs.OneDrive is a file- and photo-sharing hosting service operated by Microsoft. Users of OneDrive often share their documents with friends or colleagues via a publicly accessible unique link. OneDrive inserts the titles of documents or filenames into the browser page title. The Party Y extensions capture the URL and page title data and deliver it to a Company X customer requesting data on 1drv.ms. Using Google Analytics advanced filter tools, metadata such as page titles are searchable. Figure 14 illustrates a page title search query for the word “tax.” The redacted results include the URLs to page titles such as “2018 Tax Return [REDACTED],” where the redacted text is often an individual’s name. A cybercriminal can access these documents and use the data in them to steal identities and/or view financial income, bank account numbers, social security numbers, and other confidential information.<img class="wp-image-68" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27.png 1934w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27-300x225.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27-768x577.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27-1024x769.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-27-1568x1177.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1934px) 100vw, 1934px" />Figure 14.

Healthcare providers that use Kareo can access patient information via a web browser. Customers of Company X requesting data on Kareo.com may use Google Analytics to find patient names. Figure 15 lists redacted patient names obtained from the Company X service. Furthermore, the figure illustrates many patient names being exposed from a single city. Over a four-day period, we observed 193 unique page titles from Hunters Creek, Florida. We observed the service provider (ISP/ASN/OrgName) value for all entries originating from Hunters Creek as being listed from a single service provider: [REDACTED-CLINIC-NAME] – [REDACTED]. Moreover, we observed all page title entries associated with the visits originating from Windows 7 running Chrome. The metadata led us to suspect the patient-name leak originated from one or more staff member(s) at the unnamed clinic.<img class="wp-image-69" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-28.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-28.png 1156w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-28-235x300.png 235w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-28-768x981.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-28-802x1024.png 802w" sizes="(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px" />Figure 15.

Healthcare staff members can access such software from their offices.Customers of Company X requesting data on DrChrono.com may use Google Analytics to find patient and medication names. Figure 16 displays page title data such as “RefillRequest for [REDACTED-NAME].” In the right-hand column, many of the redacted subdomains of the hostname contain the names of various health clinics and doctors’ offices. Using collected metadata such as timestamp, browser, OS, ISP, and hostname, the metadata may be used to follow the visitor’s browser activity path and infer from this which patient is associated with which medication.<img class="wp-image-70" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-29.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-29.png 1160w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-29-300x278.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-29-768x712.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-29-1024x950.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" />Figure 16.

We observed the following page title data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X and filtered for the domain name, blueorigin.com. We observed a blueorigin.com subdomain with URL and page title data that follow patterns similar to those of Atlassian’s JIRA software (e.g., /browse/[PROJECT-KEY]-[PROJECT-ID]). Due to the sensitive nature, we have decided against publishing a screenshot. Moreover, we have removed the project-name prefixes (commonly seen with JIRA issues) and suffixes which accompany the page titles.Blue Origin page title examples:“manifold [REDACTED] contaminated with [REDACTED] material”“[REDACTED-COMPETITOR-NAME]”“Rust found in [REDACTED] manifold”“speed sensor broke during [REDACTED]”“[REDACTED] Failed Calibration”“Verify [REDACTED] can survive degrease and clean operations”FireEye is a publicly-traded cybersecurity company with offices around the world. We observed the following page title data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X and filtered for the domain name, fireeye.com. The page titles contained the phrase “JIRA” or originated from fireye.com hostnames containing that phrase. We observed the service provider (ISP/ASN/OrgName) of the visitor(s) as “fireeye inc.” The city and region metadata components match a city of one of FireEye’s office locations [8]. This leads us to suspect that a user (or users) using the fireeye inc network is impacted by the DataSpii leak.We have removed any category-name prefixes (commonly seen with JIRA issues) and suffixes which may accompany page titles. Due to the sensitive nature, we decided against publishing a screenshot. The following are FireEye.com page titles collected from visitor(s) with an ISP listed as: fireeye inc.:“URL with Malicious download missed detection [REDACTED-URL]”“Large backup fails when [REDACTED]”“As [REDACTED] engineer, I would like to run the [REDACTED]”“Expose what Engines are running on the [REDACTED]”Company X members can search, view, scrape, and save publicly accessible attachments leaked by users with Party Y extensions. This includes document, image, and video attachments from popular platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Zendesk. This vulnerability compromises the possible confidential and/or sensitive nature of the files being transmitted.The URLs to Facebook Messenger attachments may be captured by Party Y extensions (see Figure 17). In the course of our investigation, we sent a sample JPEG to a friend over Facebook Messenger. We observed the JPEG attachment being served over a publicly accessible fbcdn.net URL. While Facebook appears to append query strings that specify a time-limited window for access, Company X is able to provide these URLs in near real-time, thereby allowing access within Facebook’s time-limited window.<img class="wp-image-71" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-30.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-30.png 1550w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-30-300x267.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-30-768x683.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-30-1024x910.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px" />Figure 17.

The Zendesk website states that their customers include Uber, Airbnb, Mailchimp, GoFundMe, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Dollar Shave Club [9]. Users who submit support tickets sometimes attach files containing confidential or personal information. Using an attachment we submitted to a Zendesk portal, we observed the storage of our attachment on the zdusercontent.com domain name. We observed that the URL to our attachment is publicly accessible. During the investigation of our own Zendesk ticket attachment, we observed that even when the token query parameter was excluded, the attachment still loaded in a remote browser. We discuss redacted query strings in Section 4.1. Figure 18 shows other attachment URLs captured on the zdusercontent.com domain name. Using Google Analytics filter tools, such ticket attachments can be filtered by referrer and narrowed to the companies from which they originate.Note: Zendesk support instances have a setting which customers can enable to “Require authentication to download [attachments].” As such, the public accessibility of the zdusercontent.com URLs is dependent upon the setting the customers have in place. By default, it is not enabled.<img class="wp-image-72" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31.png 1618w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31-300x187.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31-768x478.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31-1024x637.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-31-1568x975.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1618px) 100vw, 1618px" />Figure 18. URLs to Zendesk ticket attachments on the zdusercontent.com domain name.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.In order to defend against malicious activity, businesses may protect publicly accessible URLs by using query string parameters that (a) set a time-limited window for access, (b) add an authorization string, or (c) use (a) and (b) together. However, the ability of Company X to deliver complete URLs to its customers in near real-time renders these security methods less effective, if not altogether ineffective.Per AWS S3 documentation: “By default, all S3 buckets are private and can be accessed only by users that are explicitly granted.” Administrators, however, may authenticate S3 access requests by using AWS S3 Query String Authentication. This form of authentication includes the following URL query string parameters, that can be captured by Party Y extensions:Customers of Company X requesting data on amazonaws.com can view URLs containing AWSAccessKeyId, Expires, and Signature query string parameters (explained in the previous subsection). The shopify.s3.amazonaws.com URL is one of many such examples (see Figure 19). A malicious Company X customer can view the captured data in near real-time and use it to access Shopify shipping labels and details about customer orders.<img class="wp-image-73" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32.png 2004w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32-300x190.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32-768x485.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32-1024x647.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-32-1568x991.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2004px) 100vw, 2004px" />Figure 19.

Such Facebook photo privacy settings include Public, Friends, Custom, and Only Me. Once posted, the URLs to such photos may reside on the Facebook domain, fbcdn.net.To illustrate this, we uploaded a Facebook photo and chose the Only Me photo privacy setting: URL to photo on fbcdn.net. We viewed this photo with a Party Y extension and observed the URL collection by the extension. Then, within one hour, we witnessed the delivery of the URL by Company X to our Google Analytics account (see Figure 20).<img class="wp-image-74" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33-300x176.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33-768x450.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33-1024x600.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-33-1568x918.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 20. The fbcdn.net URL to our Facebook photo defined with an “Only me” privacy setting.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.As discussed in our results, our honeypot experiment determined that our URLs collected by Party Y extensions were visited by a third party almost immediately after collection. If a third party were to scrape and collect URLs to domains like fbcdn.net, it may enable them to use facial-recognition technology to process and identify individuals visible in the image. While we could only verify visits to our own honeypot domain, third-party viewing, processing, or scraping of such content has disastrous implications for privacy.Party Y extensions can capture API authentication credentials, which poses especially vexing security issues. An API can offer software developers an easy way to integrate their software or app with another online platform. In order to serve their function, APIs often provide high-level access to an account. Malicious actors may use API keys and API secrets found on the Company X service to gain access to accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges or financial services, or to access sensitive information from any impacted corporation.An unnamed platform provides firewall protection services to businesses across the globe. The service’s web portal allows their customers to click on a link to perform firewall actions. Accessing such a link by a user with a Party Y browser extension can deliver the sensitive API key and API secret to a Company X customer requesting data on the unnamed service. A malicious Company X customer can then view customer API keys and secrets, bypass the website’s firewall, and pull the business’s logging data (see Figure 21). Unless use of the API is restricted by IP address, a bad actor can use the API data to wreak havoc on a corporation.<img class="wp-image-75" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34.png 1748w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34-300x220.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34-768x562.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34-1024x750.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-34-1568x1148.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px" />Figure 21. Customer API keys and secrets from unnamed cloud firewall provider on display.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.For added security, corporations may host their most confidential data on a private intranet that is accessible only from within the organization. For convenience, corporations frequently host their intranet portals on a subdomain of their domain name (e.g., jira.example.com). When an employee with internet and intranet access has a Party Y extension and browses intranet portals on a company subdomain, the extension captures the private intranet browsing activity data before sending it to Party Y servers, which in turn deliver the data to any Company X customer requesting it on the corporation’s domain name.Many of the page titles on the intranet subdomains include what appear to be employee tasks and issues. Data provided by Company X can provide competitors, state-sponsored actors, and cybercriminals with proprietary secrets, information about existing cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and other sensitive corporate data such as internal health memos.We employed three prongs to identify corporations impacted by this data type. First, we used readily available DNS tools to ascertain whether the hostname for a data point was publicly resolvable. Second, we ascertained the visitor’s internet service provider (ISP). Many of the impacted Fortune 500 companies act as their own ISP with their own autonomous system number (ASN). Third, we relied on city and region metadata to ascertain if the visitor was near an impacted company’s place of operation.We ascertained whether the three conditions listed below occurred. If at least two of the conditions occurred (condition 1 being required), we then presumed that the page visit was from a LAN environment, suggesting that a network user or staff member of the corporation may have a Party Y browser extension:We denote each page title with one of the following notations:‖ All three conditions occurred.¦ Conditions 1 and 3 are confirmed. We use this notation to acknowledge that not all companies operate their own ASN. In addition, some users may use a VPN to access a corporate LAN while maintaining a wide-area-network (WAN) IP via their local ISP, such as Comcast.§ Conditions 1 and 2 are confirmed, and the City and Region metadata were missing.Due to the sensitive page title data, we do not provide screenshots but instead provide the redacted examples in text. The prefixes and suffixes that identify the category or task, like those used by JIRA, have been removed as well. We raise this note to make readers aware that most page titles belong to a subcategory of the removed category prefix under which those page titles were raised.The following page titles were obtained from Company X, and we identify the pages as originating from a private LAN environment:‖ “Vaccines not being marked as completed once administered”‖ “Case Delays due to Emergent Case after Patient is In Room”‖ “PRN Medications administered multiple times”‖ ”Giving OR Nurses Access to [REDACTED]”‖ “Timed PT Services are Displayed and Calculated Incorrectly on The Billing Tab”‖ ”Newborns not showing up in [REDACTED]”2.7.2 Pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, and Roche‖ “[REDACTED] Samples were approved without approving the test results”§ “URGENT Missing Samples [REDACTED]”§ “Revise Sample Limit of [REDACTED] 5mg to [REDACTED] Packs per person/year”‖ “[REDACTED] Aliquotting Issue prevents [REDACTED] from fully documenting [REDACTED]”‖ “Personnel plates were not marked as sampled”‖ “User Approved own entered results”‖ “We would like to use Jira as a ticketing system for handling request based on privacy regulations globally”§ “MR Review Single [REDACTED-DRUG-NAME] [REDACTED]”‖ “Samples are showing Out of Spec even when the results are In spec”‖ “[REDACTED] admin disable api key”‖ “Need the Parent [REDACTED] ID visible when attempting to match customers, see attachment for more detail”‖ “Update library dependencies per [REDACTED] vulnerabilities”‖ “Unpatched Library/Software: [REDACTED] Risk-High – [REDACTED] Jira”‖ “[REDACTED] Insufficient [REDACTED-SECURITY-ISSUE]‖ “MFA access does not work through [REDACTED].”Note: MFA is an acronym often used for multifactor authentication.

One Fortune 500 company’s private LAN data included the following page titles:“Add client [REDACTED-LAN-IP-ADDRESS] to NFS export list on [REDACTED-SERVER-NAME]”“Supermicro PSUs are bad”“Please install latest CentOS on [REDACTED]”“Snapshot strategy: Moving from 30 dailies, to 5 dailies, and 2 weeklies”“Need [REDACTED-FOLDER] exported for NFS for [REDACTED-LARGE-LAN-IP-BLOCK]”A bad actor’s access to such data will inform him or her of the following:(1) the Fortune 500 company’s disaster recovery strategy;(2) the brand of hardware in use;(3) the IP address to a server that has access to an NFS storage unit;(4) the company’s preferred Linux distribution; and(5) a large LAN IP block with full access to a folder.Such data can be used by bad actors to pinpoint attack vectors and plan a large-scale breach.To identify the extensions involved in data collection, we began our analysis by reviewing the first reported extension: Hover Zoom. In order to view the data captured by the extension, we analyzed the extension in an isolated environment. We used this controlled environment to verify whether the data was being collected by the extension, to decode and decompress the data, and to verify whether it was accessible via the Company X service.In order to set up an environment with minimal interference, we employed the following:We used Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox to verify that the leak can occur on macOS, Ubuntu, Windows, and Chrome OS (the OS used on Chromebooks).For analysis, we used Burp Suite as well as Chrome’s Development Tools; specifically, we used “Inspect views background page” for each extension. We inspected the background page to monitor live events and network traffic requests initiated by the extension. We reviewed historical and live events via Burp Suite. We noted the timestamp, hostname, URL query strings, HTTP status, response length, the raw requests and responses for each request, and the sequence of the requests. We then searched for temporal patterns and anomalous requests such as an unusually long response length that occurred while the browser was idle. Such high response lengths may indicate either the download of an extension’s data collection instruction set or the more commonly observed automated extension update.In some cases, the raw responses of requests contained minified source code, making it difficult to read. We used readily available unminification tools (e.g., Atom Beautify, unminify.com, beautifier.io) to translate the code into a more readable format. For additional extension source code analysis, we used Rob Wu’s CRX Viewer. We informed ourselves with actionable intelligence provided by Duo Security’s CRXcavator. We used PacketTotal’s PCAP historical analysis database to perform research on the hostnames that we uncovered via Burp Suite. For the historical WHOIS and hosting information of those hostnames, we used DomainTools.com. For greater hosting and DNS insight, we further assessed the hostnames and IPs using Farsight Security’s historical DNS database. We also performed a quantitative text and source code analysis of each extension author’s website, including the extension’s terms of service and privacy policy pages. In order to find similar sites and extensions, we used search engine tools such as PublicWWW.com to perform reverse source code lookups.In order to provide a consistent experience across all devices, Chrome’s Sync function automatically syncs bookmarks, history, settings, and browser extensions across all computers logged into Chrome using a Gmail account. Consequently, an invasive extension combined with the browser’s syncing behavior enables data collection from all logged-in locations (e.g., home and work computers).The browser’s powerful API functions allow extensions to tap into browser activity. When an invasive extension is installed within the browser, it can access page content — regardless of whether the site being visited is listed as secure (i.e., it uses HTTPS) or insecure (i.e., it does not use HTTPS). The extension may then collect data and send it off to a server for processing.Company X-provided page URL data of AA.com (American Airlines) displayed redacted last names with “*****”. During our analysis of Hover Zoom’s POST requests in Burp Suite, we observed redaction of common query string parameters such as “lastName.” However, passenger names from Company X-provided URL data of Southwest.com (Southwest Airlines) were unredacted. Our observations suggest that this is due to the query string parameter (passengerLastName) employed by Southwest’s web developers. Hover Zoom exhibited redaction capabilities for obvious query string parameters; however, we did not observe such behavior for variations of such parameters.During our analysis of SuperZoom’s POST requests, we did not observe any redaction capabilities. As a result, query string parameters such as lastname, firstname, username, password, ssn, and apikey, were not redacted, and were visible in data delivered to customers of Company X (see Figures 22 and 23).<img class="wp-image-76" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35.png 1752w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35-300x132.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35-768x338.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35-1024x450.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-35-1568x689.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1752px) 100vw, 1752px" />Figure 22. Company X-provided data on our page visits using a browser with the SuperZoom extension. Visible are the unredacted query strings values for lastname, username, ssn, cc, password, and apikey. Using Burp Suite, we observed the unredacted data in SuperZoom’s POST request to cr-input.superzoom.net.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.<img class="wp-image-77" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36.png 1676w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36-300x55.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36-768x141.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36-1024x188.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-36-1568x288.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1676px) 100vw, 1676px" />Figure 23. Company X-provided data for our own domain.We did, however, note that some redaction was performed post-collection. Using a browser with a Party Y extension, we submitted a URL with the parameter “[email protected]” In each instance, regardless of whether the extension performed redaction of the email address, the address was delivered to us by Company X with the redactionWe observed all eight extensions perform POST requests to hostnames that resolve to two groups of IPs. The first group, identified as Group A, consists of five hostnames that were observed from four extensions. The five hostnames from Group A resolve to the same two IP addresses and use a subdomain of the following names: “cr-b” or “ff-b.” The second group, identified as Group B, consists of eight hostnames that all resolve to the same five IP addresses. IP Group B hostnames use subdomains of the following patterns: “cr-input” or “ff-input.” We observe that all invasive Chrome extensions send their requests to hostnames that begin with “cr.” All invasive Firefox extensions send their requests to hostnames that begin with “ff.”Using the available toolsets, we uncovered Party Y hostnames being used in data collection for Company X (see Table 3).Table 3. GET and POST request Hostnames used by Party Y extensions.Each Group A hostname has two DNS A records that resolve to 34.195.36.59 and 52.200.192.173.Each Group B hostname has five DNS A records that resolve to 52.44.145.169, 34.231.181.237, 34.237.105.7, 52.204.245.185, 54.160.162.145, and 52.72.99.240.We observed eight Party Y extensions making GET or POST requests to one or more of the Table 3 hostnames.We uncovered other hostnames, as well; however, we were unable to link them to any extension (see Table 4). These hostnames use DNS A records that point to the same DNS A records as those discussed in Table 3’s respective Group A and B hostnames. It is possible these extensions were already flagged or removed from browser vendor stores. If you, the reader, recognize any of the following hostnames to an extension, or believe there are other extensions involved, please report them using the extension report form.Table 4. Hostnames not yet identified with any particular extension.Notwithstanding the SaveFrom.net Helper extension, the privacy policies of the other five extensions are nearly identical. They share the same verbiage. FairShare Labs, PanelMeasurement, and Super Zoom listed the same business address on the extension author website, extension Chrome web store page, or extension privacy policy page, respectively. Links to the policies can be found in the appendices.To simplify the results for the body of our report, we analyzed a single extension, Hover Zoom. Figures and analyses for the other five extensions can be found in the appendices.Immediately after the installation of Hover Zoom, we observed a GET request to cr-b.hvrzm.com containing query strings noting a unique browser ID, the extension’s installation time, install version, current version, and Hover Zoom’s Chrome extension ID. Using screenshots from Burp Suite, we present these requests in Figures 24 through 34. We identify the individual GET and POST requests using the request number located in the left-hand column of the screenshot (see Figure 24).We observed the extension’s automated update to a new version, but, once again, we did not observe the collection of browsing activity data; however, 24 days after installation, we did observe a second automated update to the extension. Immediately following the second automated update, a GET request to cr-b.hvrzm.com was again performed with query strings noting the unique browser ID, installation time, install version (noted as two versions prior), current version, and Chrome extension ID (see Figure 25). One second later, another GET request was made, notably with a 156KB response payload. Following this request, all subsequent browser activity data was collected and sent via POST request to cr-input.hvrzm.com. Notably, the cr-input.hvrzm.com hostname does not appear in the original source code of the extension, nor does it appear in an installation on a new device. In Figure 26, we observe a unique reason query string parameter in the GET request. Figure 27 is the 156KB response payload to Figure 26’s GET request. We found 150KB of the original 156KB response payload stored in a file located in the Google Chrome profile’s File System folder, C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\File System\002\p\00\00000000. Upon examination of this payload, we observed minified JS data containing encoding and compression instructions, and we also observed the introduction of the cr-input.hvrzm.com hostname. We provide an unminified view of the 00000000 file in Figure 28.Immediately following the download of the 156KB payload, a subsequent GET request was made noting a config statement in the URL (see Figure 29). In Figure 30, we observed the GET response to the config statement, which noted a batch_size of 10 and batch_max_wait of 600,000. Figure 31 illustrates how Hover Zoom waited until > 9 URLs had been collected before it made a POST request to cr-input.hvrzm.com. If fewer than 10 URLs were collected, it made a POST request with that data within 600,000 milliseconds (10 minutes). We browsed one page (request #12643) on the text.npr.org website. Precisely 10 minutes after request #12643, we observed POST request #12645 to cr-input.hvrzm.com containing a compressed and encoded payload.<img src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-37.png" />Figure 24. GET request #113. On Feb 5, 2019 at 1:03 a.m., Hover Zoom was installed on a newly provisioned Windows Server 2016 Standard virtual machine with Google Chrome, Burp Suite, and the FoxyProxy Standard extension preinstalled. FoxyProxy Standard was used to proxy this information back to Burp Suite. Immediately upon Hover Zoom installation, we observed GET request #113 to cr-b.hvrzm.com with query string parameters notating the “installTime” and unique browser ID. After installation, we did not observe the collection of browser activity data until March 1, 2019.<img class="wp-image-79" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38-300x108.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38-768x277.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38-1024x370.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-38-1568x566.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 25. GET request #2102. On March 1, 2019 at 8:00 a.m., a GET request was made to cr-b.hvrzm.com containing query strings noting the unique browser ID, original installTime recorded as a UNIX epoch timestamp, installVersion, and current extension version (currentVersion), as well as the Chrome extension ID (cid). This request immediately followed an automatic update to the Hover Zoom extension (request #2101).<img class="wp-image-80" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39-300x111.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39-768x285.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39-1024x381.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-39-1568x583.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 26.

Request #12642. On March 11, 2019, we logged into the VM to check for any changes. We browsed several sites, including 10 pages on text.npr.org. After we visited those pages, we observed a POST request to cr-input.hvrzm.com. The payload contained compressed and encoded data of our browsing activity.  We have published our DataSpii decoder tool to decode any payload data: https://decoder.dataspii.com. In addition, precisely 10 minutes after request #12643, we observed POST request #12645 to cr-input.hvrzm.com containing a compressed and encoded payloadTo ascertain whether our browsing activity was accessible via Company X’s service, we used a browser with the actively data-collecting Hover Zoom extension. We then visited a domain under our own control, for which we had already requested analytics data via the Company X dashboard. We visited a unique URL on our domain. See Figure 32 (request is highlighted in red) for the POST request containing our browsing activity.<img class="wp-image-86" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45-300x175.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45-768x447.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45-1024x596.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-45-1568x913.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 32.

The URL containing some redacted query string parameters from GET request #12589 (Fig. 32) is visible in the Google Analytics account that received its data from the Company X service.Note: This is a screenshot of data within a Google Analytics account populated by Company X.The two users we identified via the data collected from Company X had one extension in common: Hover Zoom. From the outset of our investigation of Hover Zoom, we encountered several obstacles to identifying the extensions and observing the data collection process. The obstacles included dilatory tactics, encoding and compression, prevention of crawling by search engine crawlers, and evolving behavior, as detailed below.During the course of our investigation, we observed dilatory tactics by Hover Zoom and SpeakIt!. We observed this tactic on multiple OS platforms, on virtual machines (VMs) located in several geographic regions, and at various hosting providers that use different ASNs. We observed these extensions undergo two stages of updating before downloading a data collection instruction set.February 5, 2019: We installed (via the Chrome Web Store) the latest version of SpeakIt!, 0.3.10, on one VM and the latest version of Hover Zoom, 6.0.40, on another VM. Since we did not observe any browsing activity data collection at the time of installation, we surmised that either there was no data collection or that that was a quiescent period after which data collection could begin.February 15, 2019: We observed each extension perform an automated Chrome extension update. Hover Zoom was updated to version 6.0.41, and SpeakIt! to version 0.3.11. We did not observe any collection of browsing activity data after the update.March 1, 2019: We observed each extension perform an automated Chrome extension update. Hover Zoom was updated to version 6.0.42, and SpeakIt! to version 0.3.12.March 1, 2019: Seconds after the update, we observed a GET request to cr-b.hvrzm.com (Hover Zoom) or cr-b.getspeakit.com (SpeakIt!), with a response payload containing a data collection instruction set. Following the GET request, all subsequent user browser activity data was collected and sent via a POST request to cr-input.hvrzm.com (Hover Zoom) or cr-input.getspeakit.com (SpeakIt!).May 22, 2019: We installed SpeakIt! version 0.3.21 (the latest version at the time) on a VM located in a different geographic region and at a different hosting provider.June 1, 2019: SpeakIt! was automatically updated to version 0.3.22. After the update, we did not observe any browsing activity data collection.June 15, 2019: We observed an automatic update to SpeakIt! version 0.3.23.June 15, 2019: Seconds after the update, we observed a GET request to cr-b.getspeakit.com. This GET request’s response payload contained the data collection instruction set. Following this request, all subsequent user browser activity data was collected and sent via a POST request to cr-input.getspeakit.com.We repeated this experiment six times, under numerous scenarios; each time we obtained the same result. In the past, similar tactics have been used to avoid detection of data collection. As of May 9, 2019, more than 2.29 million people use Hover Zoom and SpeakIt!.Encoding and compression technologies can be used by extensions to evade the detection of data collection. Such technologies can obfuscate data and limit bandwidth consumption. We observed the use of an LZ-based compression algorithm by Hover Zoom, SpeakIt!, FairShare Labs, and PanelMeasurement (see Table 5). Using Burp Suite and a Windows grep tool, we identified the response payload involved in encoding and compression. We identified a file in the Chrome profile’s File System folder containing the response payload.To assist our analyses, we developed a tool for decoding and decompressing the POST request payloads from all Party Y browser extensions. The DataSpii decoder tool can be found at https://decoder.dataspii.com.Table 5. Encoding and compression used for SpeakIt!’s POST requests to cr-input.getspeakit.com.We observed a robots.txt file with instructions to specifically prevent search engines from crawling the terms of service and privacy policy pages on four out of the eight extension authors’ websites. We circumvented the obstacle by performing additional searches on other suspected matching data, such as the corporate street address listed for the extensions.The evolving behavior of Party Y extensions complicated our research. Over the last five months, we observed several newly downloaded data collection instruction sets containing new encoding and compression methods, further hindering our decoding process. These changes required us to modify our DataSpii decoder so we could analyze the new data collection instructions sets. On May 8, 2019, for instance, we observed Hover Zoom’s introduction of a new hostname, pnldsk.adclarity.com. We then observed Hover Zoom making encoded POST requests to this hostname using a new encoding method.In addition, we initially observed a Party Y extension making POST requests for every 10 URL visits; weeks later, we observed the same extension making POST requests for every 50 URL visits. The extension modified its behavior when the response payload of a GET request increased a batch_size value from 10 to 50.We visited a web page on a URL of our own domain using a browser with a Party Y extension. To classify the URL as a unique, we appended query string parameters that specified the time, OS, browser, and Party Y extension. To minimize outside interference, we avoided the use of analytics snippets and third-party trackers in the page code (see Figure 35).<img class="wp-image-89" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-48.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-48.png 1346w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-48-300x160.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-48-768x409.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-48-1024x545.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" />Figure 35. Source code of the samtesting.html page.Within one hour of the collection, the unique URL appeared in the Google Analytics account populated by Company X. Within 3.5 hours of the collection, we observed a third party visiting the unique URL. Over the course of several weeks, we visited more than two dozen unique URLs on our control domain. We performed this test with each of the eight extensions. Within three to five hours of each visit, a third party visited the unique URLs collected on our domain. Except for large attachments, we observed this visitation pattern 100% of the time. The rapid third-party visitation of collected URLs compromises the security of publicly accessible URLs and ephemeral links. Such visitation enables third parties to process and scrape the page contents of the URL.While visiting unique URLs using a browser with a Party Y extension, we observed third party visits from several IPs, which all originated from AWS netblocks. We used DomainTools.com and standard DNS lookup tools to verify that the IP’s forward and reverse DNS records match. Table 6 presents the IP addresses, ASN owner, and hostname. We then observed the IP addresses matching forward and reverse DNS records, all of which originated from the kontera.com domain.Table 6: Third-party IPs visiting URLs collected by our browser using a Party Y extension.Test 1. We visited our unique URL using Chromium 74.0.3684.0 with the SuperZoom extension on macOS. Note: The server time was logged in GMT.

When visiting the zip file, the browser downloaded the file into the file system. It did not load them directly in the browser. As a result, we did not observe the transmission of the zip URL to a third-party hostname. However, the SQL files were loaded in the browser and the URL of our SQL files was transmitted to cr-input.hvrzm.com. Three hours after it was collected by the Party Y extension, we observed a third-party visit to our SQL file:184.72.115.35 – – [18/May/2019:12:50:27 +0000] “GET /dataspii-sql-50000rows.sql HTTP/1.1” 200 4393501 “-” “Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) AppleWebKit/600.1.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Safari/600.1.25”As noted in the log entry above, the entirety of the file, 4393501 bytes, was requested and transmitted to the visitor’s IP: 184.72.115.35. Using a browser with a Party Y extension, we visited an SQL file that was 8MB in size, but we did not observe the expected third-party file request. Perhaps this was due to the larger file size.We set up a non-publicly resolvable website on a web server which contained three HTML pages and one CSS file. The primary index page and two additional HTML pages each include images with hyperlinks to the other two pages. Each page also references a CSS file. We placed these HTML pages on a web server accessible only via a private LAN. We browsed the website using the following method:In this experiment, we used the Hover Zoom Chrome extension. We visited two (non-publicly resolvable) URLs on our LAN, which we denote as URL 1 and URL 2. We monitored all connections by using Burp Suite or Chrome Development Tools’ “Inspect views background page” option for the Party Y extension. We then verified whether our data was retrievable using the Company X service. We denote URL 1 and URL 2 below:http://dataspii-lan-experiment-on-non-publicly-resolvable-hostname.[REDACTED].com/index.html?&os=win&brow=chrome&v=74.0.3729.131&ext=HZ&date=may162019&time=117ampst&lantest=yes&usinghostsfilefordns=yes&ispublic=no&ishostnamepubliclyresolveable=no&withoutfoxyproxy=yeshttp://dataspii-lan-experiment-on-non-publicly-resolvable-hostname.[REDACTED].com/corporate-passwords-stored-here.htmlAfter visiting the URLs, we observed Hover Zoom making POST requests to three different hostnames:These POST requests occurred on ports 443 and 40443.Using Chrome’s Development Tools’ inspect views background page feature, we observed the encoded POST request and decoded it with our DataSpii decoder tool (see Figure 36).<img class="wp-image-90" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49-300x97.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49-768x248.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49-1024x331.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-49-1568x506.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 36. Decoded cr-input.hvrzm.com POST request containing browser activity data of website hosted on our private LAN. The website used a non-publicly resolvable hostname of a domain name we own.The captured metadata included the site’s LAN IP address (10.10.33.5), page title, timestamp, and URL visited, as well as the URLs of the resources within the page, including CSS files, JS files, and images. The captured data included many elements of the HTTP header, including server type, content security policy, timestamp, access-control-allow-methods, access-control-allow-credentials, access-control-max-age, last-modified timestamp, and more (see Section 4.5.1 for more information).We visited URL 2 on our private LAN, observed the encoded POST request to cr-input.hvrzm.com using Burp Suite, and decoded it with the DataSpii decoder (see Figure 37).<img class="wp-image-91" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50-300x29.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50-768x74.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50-1024x99.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-50-1568x151.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 37. Decoded cr-input.hvrzm.com POST request containing URL 2.We observed Hover Zoom sending an encoded POST request to a second hostname, pnldsk.adclarity.com. We decoded that request with our DataSpii decoder. The decoded request included values for panelistId, ticketId, the URL we visited on our private LAN, and several encoded values for content (see Figure 38). We subsequently ran one content value through a standard base64 decoder, which revealed the capture of hyperlinks that were coded within our web page. The content value also included the image source URL used for the hyperlink (see Figure 39). Such data could be used by bad actors to map LAN infrastructure.<img class="wp-image-92" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51-300x101.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51-768x259.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51-1024x345.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-51-1568x528.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 38.

The decoded request contained the URL that was visited on our LAN as well as the user agent (UA) of our browser (see Figure 40).<img class="wp-image-94" src="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53.png" srcset="https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53.png 2500w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53-300x16.png 300w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53-768x40.png 768w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53-1024x54.png 1024w, https://securitywithsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-53-1568x82.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />Figure 40. Decoded POST request data sent to p.ymnx.co.Quantifying Party Y’s collection of PII and CI and their dissemination by both Party Y and Company X warrants further investigation. We do not know the number of Company X members or the domains for which they requested data. In addition, the total number of data points collected or disseminated is difficult to ascertain. Company X does not include historical data to their customers. Company X provides the real-time data as it is being captured (with a one-hour delay) to a member’s Google Analytics account. The data is then saved, collated, and made available to the Company X member. In addition, Company X members can log into a dashboard and share the data with anyone who has a Gmail account.Second, data collection companies are in the business of selling data. Our investigation did not set out to examine links between Party Y’s business transactions or legal relationships with other companies. However, as mentioned in Section 4.3, we observed third parties visiting the unique URLs captured by Party Y extensions. Such capability is dangerous to global security.Before March of 2019, customers of Company X that requested the data of a domain could see the number of hits made to it. Using the data we requested for fbcdn.net as an example, over a 30-day period we observed 60,267,694 hits to that domain. A Google Analytics hit is defined as “[a]n interaction that results in data being sent to Analytics. Common hit types include page tracking hits, event tracking hits, and ecommerce hits” [11].In addition, over that same 30-day period, we recorded the number of Google Analytics hits from 28 domains via the Company X service. The combined hit count was over 246 million. For reference, 3 of the 28 domains are ranked in the Alexa Top 100, 17 of the 28 domains in the Top 5000, and the remaining 8 are outside of the top 5000. We estimate that within one year, the hit count of these 28 domains would be in the billions.Using an unnamed airline as an example, a 28-day period in March of 2019 yielded nearly two million Google Analytics property hits for that airline. During that period, we observed 175,000+ unique URLs, of which 8,500 URLs contained passenger names, yielding an average of 304 unique URLs of passenger names per day. Using this number as a daily average, we estimate an exposure of over 110,000 unique URLs containing passenger names per year.Note: These are not scientific measurements. We acknowledge that there are many variables, such as: a Party Y extension’s active installation count during any period, evolving extension behavior, passenger traffic patterns over the course of the year, etc. In addition, the addition or removal of one individual (e.g., a travel agent) with a Party Y extension, could greatly affect these results.We recognize that Hover Zoom, SpeakIt!, PanelMeasurement, and FairShare Unlock have made some effort to redact PII during data collection. We observed redaction measures for query string parameters such as firstName and lastName; however, the measures did not cover all variations, such as first and last (see Figure 34). For example, Southwest.com uses the query string parameter, passengerLastName. We observed unredacted last names in all URLs containing the passengerLastName parameter in Southwest.com traffic data obtained from Company X.Furthermore, the redaction abilities did not include employee tasks and other CI from page titles, nor did any Party Y extension exclude data collected from LAN environments. Moreover, we did not observe redaction of any PII or CI by SuperZoom and SaveFrom.net Helper. We noted a single exception: email addresses. For example, we observed the collection of unredacted email addresses by SuperZoom; however, the email addresses appeared in redacted format on the Company X platform. We presume the redaction of email addresses occurred by a third-party processor or by Company X.When corporate staff use extensions such as Hover Zoom while browsing pages on their LAN, the extensions may be acting as real-time private LAN crawlers. As seen in Figures 36 through 39, we discovered Hover Zoom’s ability to capture LAN IPs, hostnames, web server technology data, and even the hyperlinks embedded within our page. We then observed Company X disseminating LAN data to its members in near real-time. (Note that whereas Hover Zoom appears to collect many types of metadata, Company X does not appear to provide all the metadata types [e.g., last-modified] to its customers.) Armed with such data, a bad actor could create a detailed network topology of an organization’s private infrastructure. In addition, the collation of such data facilitates the identification of internal disaster recovery systems, firewalls, routers, switches, and web server technologies. Such detailed information can, in turn, be used to monitor and exploit vulnerabilities.After reporting a Party Y extension to a browser vendor, the vendor remotely disabled the extension for all users; however, that did not stop the data collection. While the extension ceased its functionality, we continued to observe our browsing activity being sent via POST request to Party Y servers. The data collection stopped when we removed the extension. Moreover, a second report to a browser vendor resulted in the extension’s removal from the extension store; however, the extension was not remotely deactivated. It remained active and working in our test environment.The continuous evolution of data collecting extensions, weak browser vendor policies, and the general complacency about publicly accessible unique URLs have engendered the DataSpii leak. Data collection via privacy-violating browser extensions has been a well-documented issue for nearly two decades [12]. Party Y extensions are a few of many privacy-violating extensions. While Google and Mozilla may decide to improve their extension-vetting processes or increase their browser protections, browser extensions are merely one of many avenues where data collection occurs. In addition, data-mining firms will continue to collect data via other platforms (e.g., mobile).We recommend that developers, corporations, and cybersecurity professionals act preemptively to prevent the leaking of PII and CI via metadata. This includes removing PII, CI, and confidential material within metadata such as URLs. We propose that companies further protect their APIs by restricting access to whitelisted IP addresses. In addition, file sharing services such as Dropbox should increase protections by expanding their premium features such as file expiration into their free tier. The restriction of such features to only the premium tier poses global risks.The companies impacted by the capture of LAN data, as listed in this report, may want to consider changing their local environments by, for instance, modifying LAN network IP ranges or subnets.Mozilla’s Firefox Send is a file sharing service with enhanced security features that protect against leaks. Users of this service upload files and share the links with others. Unlike other file sharing services, Firefox Send, by default, sets URLs to expire in 24 hours and one download. In addition, Firefox Send does not insert the file or document name into metadata such as the page title. Such default measures protect users against the DataSpii leak.Our research on DataSpii arose out of sheer serendipity. While attempting to sign up with Company X’s well-known sister company, we were redirected to Company X’s site. We thought we were signing up with the sister company, yet we were, in reality, signing up with Company X. At first glance, Company X’s claims of viewing any domain’s traffic data seemed dubious. Instead of canceling our free trial with Company X, we instead opted to continue the trial to see where our observations would lead us. Within days of requesting data of a domain under our control, we recognized unique URLs that could only have been accessed by specific users. Since Company X states that it provides data only from desktop browsers, browser extensions and their access to privileged API features naturally emerged as the culprit.Having associated unique URLs with users of domains under our control, we then asked three of the impacted users to provide us with a list of their browser extensions. Taken aback by the implications, the first user had immediately deleted all browser extensions and was, as a result, unable to identify the extension names. The other two users provided us with lists of their browser extensions, which revealed one common denominator: Hover Zoom. The first user was using Firefox on Ubuntu, the second was using Chrome on a Chromebook running Chrome OS, and the third was using Chrome on Windows. Despite Company X’s claim that its users have opted for their data to be collected, Hover Zoom users we spoke with were unaware of the collection or could not recall agreeing to it. The discrepancy between what the company claims and what the users experienced prompted our investigation.Initially, we theorized a sensor sitting at the edge of an ISP or corporate network. While a sensor could in theory capture unencrypted data, it would not be able to do so from websites enforcing the HTTPS protocol. However, similar to our methodology using Burp Suite, network monitoring systems can allow enterprises to monitor HTTPS traffic via Certificate Authority (CA) certificates as deployed by group policy. Considering that Company X was able to present encrypted data outside of corporate environments, this was beyond the capability afforded by the use of a sensor. This technology ignores Company X’s ability to provide encrypted data that originated outside of corporate environments. Barring a catastrophic vulnerability in encryption protocols, a more plausible explanation would be that local software was capturing browsing activity data. While we cannot rule out additional forms of collection, the most logical explanation was the privileged API features afforded to browser extensions.Second, we reviewed the methods used by Party Y and Company X to ascertain whether our findings could be spurious. In theory, we acknowledge it is possible to submit invalid data to Group B hostnames such as cr-input.hvrzm.com, which data could then be delivered to members of Company X. In addition, an IP address’s netblock owner could be modified to any owner name by modifying the ASN or OrgName records at the regional internet registry (RIR) (e.g., ARIN).We believe such orchestration is unlikely, for several reasons. First, any practical gains would be minimal compared to the effort required to fabricate a data collection scenario like DataSpii. The amount of resources required to achieve such a feat only to sell the data at a nominal cost would be illogical. Furthermore, the orchestrator would jeopardize profit. Secondly, even if it were practical, no corporation would want to invite the scrutiny such orchestration would entail. Third, it is unprecedented. If we assume the orchestration occurred, there would be many technical obstacles. An orchestrator would have to fabricate employee tasks, LAN hostnames, and page URLs. The orchestrator would then have had to identify and associate service providers and their IP addresses with fabricated visitors. The orchestrator would concoct extensions as a ruse only to sell the data at nominal fees. For these reasons and others, we believe that DataSpii was a bonafide leak on a catastrophic scale.Other investigations into browser extensions that collect data have been recently published [13,14]. In one such investigation, Weissbacher et al. employed a novel prototype, Ex-Ray, to identify privacy-violating extensions on a large scale. In the process, they uncovered the extension SpeakIt!, just as we did. The authors dismissed the likelihood of dormancy given the economic incentive for the immediate collection of data via privacy-violating extensions. Had the authors monitored the extensions as long as we did, they may well have replicated our findings of dormancy.In another investigation, Kapravelos et al. used Hulk, a novel system comprising of HoneyPages and a fuzzer, to simulate the behavior of extensions [15]. During the course of our investigation, several Party Y extensions required 10 or 50 page visits before eliciting a POST request with the browser activity data. We observed the batch_size parameter in response to GET requests by repeated manual input, a process that systems like Hulk could obviate.In 2018, Quan and Kapravelos employed a novel prototype called Mystique to uncover browser extension data leaks [16]. Of the 181,683 extensions analyzed in the study, 3,868 (2.13%) emerged as candidates for leaking sensitive data. Although a step in the right direction, approaches like Mystique may not be suited to uncovering leaks concealed by dilatory tactics. We propose that Mystique and Ex-Ray extend the period of monitoring, just as we did.Inspired by these prior investigations, we developed the DataSpii decoder tool to decode and decompress the data collected by Party Y extensions. The DataSpii decoder enables instant analysis of the collected data, allowing us to identify the capture of sensitive private LAN data from Party Y extensions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully employ metadata analyses to accurately identify impacted individuals and corporations.Our investigation determined that Party Y extensions had been providing sensitive data to members of the Company X service. We made several key observations in this regard. First, browser extensions like SpeakIt! and Hover Zoom employed dilatory tactics. The collection of data began 24 days post installation. Second, third-party visits to the unique URLs collected by Party Y extensions occurred. Third, a Party Y extension captured detailed, private LAN data before sending it to multiple hostnames.Based on our investigation, we offer several recommendations. First, we recommend further research using novel methods to replicate, qualify, or extend our findings. Second, we recommend that browser vendors review their extension policies. Third, we recommend that corporations enact stronger browser security policies. Fourth, we recommend that web developers remove PII and CI from metadata such as URLs.Though prudent, short-term fixes will not ultimately protect data from threats such as DataSpii. True data security will require the sustained collaboration of web developers, cybersecurity professionals, marketers, and browser vendors. The implications of our investigation transcend any one extension, website, Fortune 500 company, browser, or OS.DataSpii arose from hazardous assumptions about data security. It circumvented some of the best technological safeguards (e.g., authentication and encryption) against data leaks. Even the most responsible individuals proved vulnerable to DataSpii; with vast budgets and myriad experts on hand, even the largest cybersecurity corporations proved vulnerable to DataSpii. Our data is only as secure as those with whom we entrust it. It takes just one party to unwittingly leak another party’s data.Born of serendipity, our investigation has carefully documented a catastrophic leak on an unprecedented scale. We hope this report is evaluated by experts in the field. Once that has been done, the real work can begin.I would like to thank Bridget Vandenbosch for her editing, logo and site design, and tireless support and assistance over the last seven months. I would like to express my great appreciation to Dr. Michael Weissbacher for his valuable suggestions. Special thanks should be given to Cory Adam Gordon for his endless nights of tutoring, and for his insightful editing. I would also like to thank the tech editor who told me six months ago that my initial discovery alone was not enough. Finally, I would like to thank the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their legal assistance. This report would not have been possible without the help of the above.Appendix Quick Links:Extension #1: Hover ZoomExtension #2: SpeakIt!Extension #3: SuperZoomExtension #4: SaveFrom.net (when downloaded from en.savefrom.net using Firefox on Mac or Ubuntu)Extension #5: FairShare UnlockExtension #6: Panel MeasurementExtension #7: Branded SurveysExtension #8: Panel Community SurveysHoneypot Proof of ConceptHover Zoom: http://www.hoverzoom.net/disclosure/_pp.pdfSpeakIt!: http://skechboy.com/speakit/disclosure/_pp.pdfFairShare Unlock: http://privacy-policy.fairsharelabs.com/PanelMeasurement: https://www.panelmeasurement.com/privacySuperZoom: http://funnerapps.com/privacy.phpSaveFrom.net Helper: https://en.savefrom.net/privacy-policy.htmlBranded Surveys: https://surveys.gobranded.com/page/branded-surveys-privacy-policyPanel Community Surveys: https://www.panelmeasurement.com/privacyAvailable on: ChromeChrome Web Store extension ID: nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednblInstallation count: 811,750 users (Chrome Web Store, April 3, 2019)Chrome Web Store link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-zoom/nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednbl?hl=enWebsite/Developer: hoverzoom.netPrivacy policy: http://www.hoverzoom.net/disclosureHover Zoom’s background is provided in the Discussion section of this report.Hover Zoom’s history is provided in the Discussion section of this report.GET and POST requests to the following hostnames were observed:cr-b.hvrzm.comcr-input.hvrzm.comp.ymnx.coHover Zoom’s data collection process is cited in the Results section of this report.Available on: ChromeChrome Web Store extension ID: pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbakInstallation count: 1,494,570 users (Chrome Web Store, May 18, 2019)Chrome Web Store link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-USWebsite/developer: Skechboy.comPrivacy policy: https://skechboy.com/speakit/disclosureThe Chrome Web Store describes SpeakIt!, which has more than 1.4 million users, as a “free text to speech extension that reads selected text using TTS technology with language auto-detection” [17].

    The sun rises over an oil field in California.PUBLISHED July 16, 2019In less than 20 years, millions of people in the United States could be exposed to dangerous “off-the-charts” heat conditions of 127 degrees Fahrenheit or more, a startling new report has found. In 60 years over one-third of the population could be exposed to such conditions, “posing unprecedented health risks,” the report says.This first United States county-by-county look at what climate change will do to temperature and humidity conditions in the coming decades finds few places that won’t be affected by extreme heat.DANGEROUSDAYS AHEADExtreme heat kills hundreds every year across the U.S. Without any action to stop climate change, the global average temperature is expected to rise 7.7˚F, meaning more dangerously hot days. Many parts of the country are going to experience over a month more sweltering days by 2050, and some of the largest metro areas will be baking for almost half the year.Increase in number ofdangerous days per year(2019-2050) 45–5620–3435–3940–440–19more days per yearAppalachianMountainsCentralLowlandsWhat constitutes a dangerous day?Because of our bodies’ natural cooling process—sweat—humidity plays a crucial role in determining the severity of a hot day.

When the combined heat index reaches 90F, many groups of people are at serious risk.10090°+heat index959085SOREN WALLJASPER AND TED SICKLEY, NG STAFFSOURCE: UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS8080100%4060Relative Humidity“We were very surprised at how steeply and quickly the number of days of dangerous heat increased in such a short time,” says Kristina Dahl, senior climate scientist at Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), and co-author of the report “Killer Heat in the United States: Climate Choices and the Future of Dangerously Hot Days.”“I don’t think anyone appreciated how quickly conditions can change,” says Dahl.Without any action to reduce global carbon emissions, parts of Florida and Texas would experience the equivalent in days of at least five months per year on average when the heat index—which includes humidity in its calculations—exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of those days will surpass 105 degrees before the end of the century.The National Weather Service’s (NWS)'s heat index goes up to 127 degrees Fahrenheit. But in as soon as 20 years the Southeast, Southern Great Plains, and Midwest will begin to experience days that are so hot they are “off the charts.” A few decades later extreme heat will affect communities in 47 states, said the report, which is also published today as a peer-reviewed study in Environmental Research Communications.Experts compare modern heat waves to the past and show what’s really going on with carbon dioxide.By mid-century (between the years 2036 and 2065), more than 250 U.S. cities will experience the equivalent of a month or more per year on average with a heat index surpassing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to just 29 cities historically. That is a conservative estimate for cities because heat added by urban heat island effects isn’t represented in the report, said Dahl.The increase in the prevalence of heat events by mid-century in this study “represents a terrifying prospect….[and] a direct and immediate threat to human health and wellbeing,” said Tom Crowther, a climate researcher at ETH Zürich, in an email. Crowther is the co-author of a recent study that looked at the future climates of the world’s biggest 520 cities and found that some, including 17 U.S. cities, will experience unprecedented climates by 2050.The study averaged together projections from 18 hyper-local climate models between April and October over 30-year periods: a historical baseline (1971–2000), midcentury (2036–2065), and late century (2070–2099). The study showed generally that the Southeast and Southern Great Plains would bear the brunt of the extreme heat, experiencing heat that currently only occurs in the Sonoran Desert, in the SouthwestAreas in those regions would experience the equivalent of three months per year on average by mid-century that feel hotter than 105 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly as hot as 115 degrees, 125 degrees, or worse.This interactive mapping tool developed for the study shows the rapid, widespread increases in extreme heat projected to occur across the United States due to climate change. Information is presented by county and includes all 3,109 counties in the contiguous U.S.The NWS heat-index scale is a metric that combines temperature and humidity and is often called the “feels like” temperature. If that reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), our bodies begin to slowly heat up to the ambient temperature. The human body’s internal temperature likes to be between 98.6 to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 38 degrees Celsius); any warmer, and it’s a fever. If our internal temperature reaches 104 degrees, all-important cellular machinery starts to break down. This is extremely dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.“We have little to no experience with ‘off-the-charts’ heat in the U.S.,” said Erika Spanger-Siegfried, lead climate analyst at UCS and report co-author. “Exposure to conditions in that range makes it difficult for human bodies to cool themselves and could be deadly,” Spanger-Siegfried said in a press release.While the upper Midwest, Northeast, and Northwest are unlikely to experience off-the-charts heat, it will still be hotter, and people and infrastructure have little ability to cope with plus-100 degree Fahrenheit heat over multiple days, said Rachel Licker, senior climate scientist at UCS and report co-author. “The rise in days with extreme heat will change life as we know it nationwide,” Licker said in a press release.Type your county into this tool to find out how hot it will be near you.Much of this extreme heat is still avoidable with steep, rapid carbon emission reductions. If future warming is kept at 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) or less, the number of days where the heat index is above 105 degrees nationwide would be slashed in half. That means about 125 million fewer people would be exposed to a month or more of such conditions, compared with our current emissions growth, the report said.However, the U.S. will still be significantly warmer than today with 85 urban areas—18 percent of those analyzed— exposed to 30 or more days with a heat index above 105 degrees, compared with just three urban areas historically. That said, if current pledges to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement are met, global temperatures will still rise by at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The Trump administration said in June 2017 that it would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.“The scale of heat impacts in this study hint at the enormous changes that climate change will mean for the U.S.,” says Richard Rood, a meteorologist and climate impacts expert at the University of Michigan.Extreme heat will not occur in isolation. There will also be droughts, wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather events that will compound the impacts of the heat, Rood said in an interview. Food production will be compromised. Add in sea level rise and there will be significant internal migration.“People are going to move, not only within the U.S. but elsewhere in the world,” he says.While it is vital to reduce emissions as quickly as possible, adaptation to the coming heat and extreme events is crucial.“Our past climate can no longer guide us. We have to build and adapt to what’s coming,” says Rood.


Former prime minister Tony Abbott has labelled wind farms "the dark Satanic Mills of the modern era" while dismissing a tongue-in-cheek campaign to install the turbines in his old Sydney electorate of Warringah.A satirical online petition has called on independent MP Zali Steggall, who ousted Mr Abbott at the May election, to install wind farms along the foreshore of the northern beaches seat.Former PM Tony Abbott at Manly Beach in his former electorate of Warringah during the election campaign.Credit:Janie BarrettOn Friday, 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones asked Mr Abbott: "How are they going with the wind turbines in your former electorate? Is Zali Steggall sticking them up there?""I think there's been a lot of wind but not too much action - and thank God, because the last thing we want is what I regard as the dark Satanic Mills of the modern era spoiling our landscape," Mr Abbott said.This was an apparent reference to a line in the poem "And did those feet in ancient time", commonly known as "Jerusalem", by the Romantic English poet William Blake.The line in the poem is generally thought to refer to either the mills of the industrial revolution, England's orthodox churches or the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.The satirical change.org petition has attracted 25,000 signatures online.Mr Abbott went on to praise Energy and Emissions Reductions Minister Angus Taylor, saying: "Angus wants to try to keep our existing coal-fired power stations like Liddell open, because we've got more and more wind and solar flooding into the system, and that's great when the wind's blowing and the sun's shining, but it doesn't always blow and it doesn't always shine."The change.org petition calls on Ms Steggall, who campaigned strongly on a platform of climate change, to "take advantage of the sea breezes" offered by Sydney's northern beaches. It has received 25,000 signatures online.Ms Steggall has not proposed wind farms in Warringah but said: "The concept behind it, which is let's be sustainable and use renewables as much as possible - whichever form is appropriate for where you're living - is fine."They think they're being funny but I don't have a problem with it. I certainly support the concept of [making] Warringah like California, as sustainable as possible," Ms Steggall said.Former Greens leader Bob Brown caused a stir this week by opposing a major wind farm development in Tasmania on the basis it would undermine the island's natural beauty and endanger wildlife without an economic dividend.In office, Mr Abbott created a "wind farm commissioner" to investigate complaints about the turbines. And his treasurer Joe Hockey, now Australia's ambassador to the United States, described such farms as "utterly offensive" and "quite appalling".The former prime minister was swept out of office in May after his primary vote collapsed by nearly 13 per cent.During the campaign, he backflipped on his call for Australia to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change (which he had signed up to as prime minister), saying that circumstances changed after Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull in the top job and Mr Taylor became energy minister.Replay Mr Abbott is currently cycling in Queensland as part of the 1000 kilometre "Pollie Pedal" charity bike ride he initiated in the 1990s. Fellow riders include Kevin Andrews, David Gillespie, Ben Morton and Mr Taylor, who will soon take over responsibility for the event.Michael Koziol is a political correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.Copyright © 2019


©2019 Press and JournalAberdeen will become the first city in the world to introduce hydrogen-powered double-decker buses.The city already operates single- decker vehicles, fuelled by the emerging technology, which proponents say is cleaner than traditional fossil fuels.A new contract was signed this month to deliver 15 city buses with the project funded by Aberdeen City Council, European Union (FCH JU) and the Scottish Government with an investment of about half a million pounds per vehicle.The vehicles will be operated by First on the 19 (Culter to Tillydrone) route.Cities that will follow in Aberdeen’s footsteps include London and Birmingham, with Dundee and Brighton and Hove being lead partners in the project.Launching later this year, the buses are more efficient than electric equivalents, with refuelling taking less than 10 minutes and offering a greater range.The buses have been produced by a UK-based company – Wrightbus based in Northern Ireland – and will complement the existing fleet in the city of 10 buses as well as a range of vans and cars.Council hydrogen spokesman Philip Bell said: “Aberdeen appears to be pushing boundaries with an innovative approach when it comes to hydrogen and the entrepreneurial and technological leadership puts Aberdeen on the global map.“Striving to tackle air pollution, these additional buses highlight Aberdeen City Council’s commitment and ambition as a ‘centre for excellence’ for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.”David Phillips, operations director for First Aberdeen, said: “We are delighted to be the first bus company to operate these unique new Wrightbus hydrogen-powered double-decker buses for the city of Aberdeen.“It is a pleasure to continue our partnership with Aberdeen City Council on this innovative project and we applaud the council in its continued support of the hydrogen bus technology. We look forward to operating these new vehicles.”Scotland’s energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “The Scottish Government has supported a number of major projects which demonstrate the use of hydrogen.“This important investment will help the city achieve its decarbonisation ambitions and further cement its reputation for innovation and technology.”David Barnett, business development director for Wrightbus, said: “The vehicle offers pioneering cities, like Aberdeen, the opportunity to replace diesel buses with zero emission buses on a one-to-one basis.”© Aberdeen Journals Ltd 2019.

1 Min ReadDUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi denied on Friday that Iran had lost a drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the United States said that a U.S. Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone.  “We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] by mistake!,” Araqchi said on Twitter, referring to a U.S. warship in the strategic waterway. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards (meters) of the USS Boxer and had ignored “multiple calls to stand down” in the latest episode to stir tensions in the Gulf.

Tension rises after Iranian forces impounded a foreign vessel with a crew of 12 in its territorial waters on Sunday.The United States on Thursday demanded Iran immediately release a vessel it seized in the Gulf as a US military commander said Washington would work "aggressively" to ensure free passage of vessels through the vital waterway.Responding to an announcement by Iran's Revolutionary Guard that it captured a foreign tanker smuggling fuel, the US State Department insisted Iran must free the ship and its crew and stop harassing vessels in and around the Strait of Hormuz.The US blames Iran for a series of attacks on shipping since mid-May in the world's most important oil artery, accusations Tehran rejects. The incidents have raised fears the long-time foes could stumble into war."The United States strongly condemns the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy's continued harassment of vessels and interference with safe passage in and around the Strait of Hormuz," a State Department spokesperson said in an email to Reuters news agency."Iran must cease this illicit activity and release the reportedly seized crew and vessel immediately."Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized the foreign tanker accused of smuggling oil with a crew of 12 on Sunday, Iranian state TV reported earlier.The impounded vessel was "smuggling one million litres of fuel" from Iranian smugglers to foreign customers, it said.Iranian television broadcast footage appearing to show patrol boats used by the Guard circling a tanker marked "Riah" and "Panama".Oil shipping monitor TankerTrackers reported the Panamanian-flagged tanker Riah, used in the Strait of Hormuz "for fuelling other vessels", crossed into Iranian waters on Sunday. It said the tanker's automatic identification system had then stopped sending signals.The announcement came a day after Iran's foreign ministry said its forces assisted a foreign ship "with technical failure" after it sent out a distress call. Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the ship impounded was the same one towed by Iranian forces."The Iranians say this tanker was initially rescued on Sunday after it sent out distress signals. But once it was towed into Larak island, they say they understood it was smuggling oil and that's when they seized it," she said, adding that the crew were arrested."The state TV, quoting the commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said Iran will not stand for this kind of piracy in the Strait of Hormuz," she added. US Central Command chief Kenneth McKenzie pledged on Thursday to ensure freedom of navigation in the highly sensitive Gulf waters, a conduit for much of the world's crude oil."We are going to work very aggressively with our partners ... to come to a solution that will enable the free passage of critical oil and other commodities ... through the region," McKenzie told reporters at an air base in Saudi Arabia, a key US ally.Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz - through which almost one-fifth of the world's oil passes - if it cannot export its oil. The Trump administration is trying to block Iran's exports as a way to pressure it to renegotiate the landmark 2015 nuclear deal it abandoned last year.The United States is not aiming to set up a military coalition against Iran with its new security initiative in the Gulf but simply "shining a flashlight" in the region to deter attacks on commercial ships, a top Pentagon official said.Kathryn Wheelbarger, who briefed NATO allies this week on the US proposal, said it was less operational and more geared towards increasing surveillance capabilities."This is not a coalition against Iran... If you were militarily confronting Iran, this is not the construct that you would use," said Wheelbarger. "The goal is to increase maritime domain awareness and surveillance capabilities in the region to dissuade malign action."Her comments came as US President Donald Trump announced the American navy in the Strait of Hormuz shot down an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of one of its vessels - further ratcheting up tensions in the Gulf. The USS Boxer "took defensive action" against the unmanned aerial vehicle as it was "threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew", Trump announced at the White House."The drone was immediately destroyed," he added.However, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said there was "no information about losing a drone today".The head of the Revolutionary Guard warned on Thursday against any aggression against his country."Iran has adopted a defensive strategy but if our enemies make any mistakes ... our strategy can become an offensive one," Hossein Salami was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.The questions over Riah's status come amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over the former's nuclear programme and a standoff between Iran and the United Kingdom over the British Royal Marines' seizure of a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier in July.The vessel was held on the suspicion it was heading to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.Tehran has called on the UK to release the vessel immediately, with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei saying his country will retaliate over the seizure of the supertanker carrying 2.1 million barrels of light crude oil.Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo had a "constructive and positive" meeting with Iranian officials in London on Wednesday over the detained Grace 1, the government said."The chief minister met yesterday in London with Iranian officials to discuss matters related to the detention of Grace 1 and to seek to de-escalate all aspects of the issues arising," a spokesman said.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin and French leader Emmanuel Macron agreed on Thursday on the need to "consolidate efforts" to save the floundering Iran nuclear deal following months of soaring tensions.In a phone call, Putin and Macron agreed the deal - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - was an "important factor in ensuring security in the Middle East and maintaining non-proliferation regime", the Kremlin said in a statement."Both sides stressed the advisability of consolidating efforts of all countries that are interested in preserving the Comprehensive Plan," it added.Inside StoryHas the door closed on diplomacy between Iran and US?

(CNN)A dangerous and potentially deadly heatwave threatens much of the continental US, with dozens of record high temperatures both in the daytime and in the evening expected this weekend. CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.


GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCalling on users experiencing issuesAnger over Joy-Con drifting issues appears to have finally boiled over, with a US law firm reportedly preparing to file a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo.Details about this come straight from Chimicles, Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith – the firm currently looking into the possibility of a such a lawsuit. Here are some additional details from its website:CSK&D is investigating a potential class action based upon reports that the Nintendo Joy-Con controller for their Nintendo Switch gaming console can experience joystick drift issues. Specifically, it is reported that the joystick on the Joy-Con will automatically register movement when the joystick is not being controlled and interfere with gameplay.This obviously isn't the first time something like this has happened. Nintendo's legal section has had to deal with plenty of other legal patent claims over the years. The firm currently making headlines is asking anyone impacted by Joy-Con drift issues to contact its attorneys, by filling out an online form.[via gonintendo.com]About Liam DoolanWhen he’s not paying off a loan to Tom Nook, Liam likes to report on the latest Nintendo news and admire his library of video games. His favourite Nintendo character used to be a guitar-playing dog, but nowadays he prefers to hang out with Judd the cat.Comments (86)happens so much that I had to send my red joycon in for repairs 3 times and my blue 1 once and then my warranty expired.Oh I have it (left)... Same one that had the launch disconnect problem (sent in to have fixed).Just waiting for my HORI Split Pad Pro (Daemon Edition) to get rid of them once and for all.They really should make a fix and put out a recall on them. While they're at it fix the dpad on the pro-controller. Joycon doesn't affect me though because they're already so uncomfortable I never use them.My Joy-Con that came with the Switch fell victim to the dreaded drift! I tried fixing it myself using guides to no avail, unfortunately. Ended up buying a new pair. I kept thinking to myself, "This is the first time I have to replace faulty Nintendo hardware." For $80, too! Get out of here with that nonsense! That's nearly halfway to buying the Switch Lite!Mine started drifting to the left. I can't remember if this was consistent throughout the other users' complaints.I love Nintendo. Always have, always will. But the JoyCon build quality is nothing short of unacceptable.I have original controllers for all Nintendo consoles dating back to the N64. Out of all of them, the Joycon is the only one to have any significant issues - and that's after owning it for less than a year.Legal action may be a bit dramatic, but Nintendo absolutely needs to change this situation, especially for the Switch Lite. With that console, if the joystick goes out, the entire console is out of commission. That's simply not right.GOOD. honestly, GOOD. I just want to see Nintendo ACKNOWLEDGE this.(and I don't care if John Doe in the comments hasn't had a problem. good for you if your Joy Con still work. thousands of people still have Joy Con issues.)Yeah, I just reminded them about the Pro Controller D-Pad, too.what took them so longGood it really amazes me that Nintendo hasn't fixed this yet.The joystick drifting issue started way back during the GameCube days when the drifting control glitch tends to happen. I'm amaze it took this long until people finally do something about it.I love Nintendo, but with so many people having issues this was bound to happen, especially with no solution offered. I actually had a drift on my 3DS that had to be fixed a few years ago.I play docked with a pro controller. I'm immune to the drift.@retro_player_22 Yeah, but like the N64 controller, that was due to wear and tear. And use. There's hardly any preventing that.These Joy-Cons were faulty on day one.So out of all the faulty horrible controllers to file a suit over...they choose this? I know that they have a drifting issue, but this is worded as if drifting is exclusive to joycons, and it is used to interfere on purpose?I don't experience drift, but the SL/SR buttons on my right Joy Con stopped working, making it impossible to play with it on its side. I don't think I did anything on my part to cause this. Would I be entitled to the same compensation, I wonder, if this investigation goes anywhere?@ilikeikeMy feelings exactly.@KingBowser86 It ain't wear and tear if the new controllers also had that same issue. Even the new Smash Ultimate GameCube controller had that same drifting control issue. It's not wear and tear, it's a flaw design that Ninty needs to figure out and fix.@retro_player_22Yep, my Pro Controller has also had problems. I used to trust Nintendo controllers.I love Nintendo. But this Joy-Con drifting problem seriously needs to be fixed. 2 pairs of Joy-Cons cost $80. I don’t want to purchase $80 worth of Joy-Cons if they are gonna have the drifting problem again. And people have sent their Joy-Cons to repair, and are experiencing the same problem with the repair. Nintendo is a very smart company, but they need to fix this issue legal action or not. Also I had a drift problem on my Wii remote where it just kept going up and down on the main menu on some on my Wii games with the D Pad. Is this normal?@TyranexxHad my right Joy-Con stick go out, made shooters extremely hard to playI don't understand, the Wii U gamepad's joysticks are just like the joycon's joysticks, so why has Nintendo downgraded the quality? Is it to save money or is it due to changes with their manufacturer?I’m on my third left joycom and it’s always the analog stick and both times getting stuck in the up directionOne of my JoyCon fell victim to drift, but it appears to have been fixed after I used compressed air to blow it out. I had two pro controllers develop drift on me, too, and I had to take them apart and clean them before they started working properly again. I hope this lawsuit actually gains some steam and Nintendo is forced to address this issue.Joy con drifts suck. For those who have this issue like me, I feel ya.2yrs in and I am on my second set and they also showing drifting a few months ago.
I refuse to buy a third one until they fixed the design flaw.
This is by far the weakest and fragile game con. from Nintendo.@Chibi_Manny The WiiU sticks aren’t like joycon sticks any more than an apple is like an orange.At this point Nintendo needs to acknowledge it is an issue. Maybe pull a Microsoft move and extend the warranty period out, just for joycons. This is another reason I won’t pull the trigger on a Lite as a second unit.Glad to hear this. I've had 3 controllers go bad without ever being dropped or any mistreatment. I'll be filling out the form.About damn time. Someone needs to see these corporations held accountable.Not just my original JoyCon, my Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Pro Controller has an issue as well. I'll be keeping an eye open on this one.I bought 3 pairs of Joy Con and the 3 have this defect, two of them I cant play anymore. And I certainly wont buy a Nintendo Lite for this reason.please anything to get nintendo to acknowledged this. joycons are pretty nifty controllers and id love to get more colors, but i want them to WORKI’ve only had this problem once and I fixed it be de- and then re-synching my controllers, and only with one of my 4 pairs of Joy-Con. And of all the other people I know with Switches, I’m the only one to have this problem.I’m genuinely curious, is it really as widespread as the Internet wants me to believe? Or is this just the vocal minority? I’m thinking the latter.I honestly believe that Nintendo has no fix for this. That’s why they didn’t knowledge it even though so many people have this issue.My left JoyCon started experiencing drifting issues several months ago. It isn't unusable but it is annoying as hell.Litigation may be a bit...extreme, but I doubt a company like Nintendo wants to be involved in any litigation whatsoever so I hope they address the issue.Well, well, well...this will be interesting.Have had this problem since October 2018, even though my year warranty expired a few months before this happened (August 29, 2018 to be exact). Let's hope something comes out of this. I would gladly demand cheaper Joy-Cons to be released!@Chibi_Manny actually no. I've had to take apart my Wii u gamepad a few times to replace the joysticks because after 3 years they finally started wearing out and were filthy. 3 years. The build quality and size of components are night and day between joycons and the Wii u gamepad. I've gone through 3 sets. All it took was 6 months of continuous use before the drifting started. I no longer own my launch day joy cons. I now have to use the pro controller for any serious gaming.@Corbs Woah Corbie, since when did you come back from the dead? Lol I just posted that I hoped this wouldn’t happen. It sucks but making a lawyer some extra cash in hopes of a 2 dollar check is a waste of time. Class actions only make companies more restrictive and less innovative the next time around. Stuff breaks. Fix it, Send it in or buy a new one.(Before someone fills my inbox with complaints/attacks which I will ignore, I am on my third pair and will fix them myself. )Can they start one for the Pro Controller D-Pad, too? I can't play Tetris 99 on either controller (crappy d-pad and joy-con drift). I sent in the Pro Controller for 2 replacements and the issue persisted. Hope some action is taken because this is an issue that Nintendo needs to address.Not surprised to see this happen. It's an issue they have not been able to fix for nearly two years. They rarely even acknowledge it.My first pair of Joycons from launch had that problem. Well the left Joycon had that problem. Joycons purchased over the past year haven't been a problem yet. With that being said, I began playing docked mostly because of this issue. This is 100% on Nintendo to fix. For a company obsessed with quality control, this one will haunt them.@Ryu_Niiyama I may find myself a massive nintendo fanboy, but even I'm not this delusional.On a different note, I have 6 pairs of joycons they can use as proof. The right joycons are just as bad as the left. Hoping this makes them change this. And they've lost a class action before, look at mario party 1.This is the first Nintendo system I've had that the controllers actually gave me problems. I still have 30+ year old NES controllers that work perfectly. It's probably why I've bought more controllers for the Switch than any other game system.First, I bought a second pair of joycon, because I noticed that just a few months of playing BoTW left discoloration in the plastic shell from the oils in my hands. I made sure to put silicone covers over my second pair.Then I bought a pro controller. The dpad was garbage. That's so strange coming from the company that invented the dpad.I bought both a Power A and 8bitdo SN30 next. There was nothing really wrong with the Power A, but it felt cheap. The SN30 was great for certain retro games, but was limited.I started building quite the collection of arcade titles. My switch was becoming the portable arcade of my childhood dreams. I wanted a controller that would give those games more authenticity, so I picked up the Hori fight stick. What a great controller! Perfect for Neo Geo and other arcade classics. It wasn't exactly portable though.I then bought a Hori Pokken controller. This was the perfect controller for just about anything 2D. It's comfortable, has a fantastic dpad, has all the buttons represented, and feels great to hold. It's also cheap. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes retro/2D/fighting games.I was still looking for that perfect, works for everything controller, so I decided to get and 8bitdo SN30 pro. What could go wrong? It's an SNES controller with all the modern additions. This one was a huge disappointment. The dpad really sucked. Super inaccurate!This was about the time where I started having drifting problems with my joycon. I wanted a dpad for portable play, so I bought a Hori dpad joycon. Another great controller from Hori. The dpad feels and works great, and it looks good. I only wish they made a wireless version.Before I figured out how to fix the drift in my joycon, I went ahead and bought a neon yellow pair. They look great and the plastic doesn't discolor like the grey ones. I luckily haven't had any problems with this pair. I bought another Hori dpad joycon (yellow Pikachu) to match.I also bought other 8bitdo controllers. I bought the wireless joystick and replaced the stick and buttons with real arcade parts. That was a fun project. I got a Sega Genesis style six button controller for the Genesis collection and M2 Sega games.The funny thing is, I really love the joycon. They're so versatile and I find them comfortable. I also like using the same exact controllers in portable and TV play. It's really too bad they have so many problems. Hopefully, Nintendo addresses all the problems, as I could see the next model switch using the same controllers. At least I hope so after my considerable investment.The moral of the story is Hori is great. I think I have a real addiction to buying Switch controllers. I've got a pre-order on the SN30 pro +. I've got my fingers crossed that they've worked out the dpad issues.My left joy-con experiences it from time to time, and it's not dirt. I solve it by recalibrating the stick, but it's annoying to be forced to do it so often.Both of my right joy con have the drifting issue as well as the left analog stick on my first party pro controller. So yeah, it sucks@HexagonSun The only non Nintendo switch controller that I have an issue with is my Wii U gamepad. But my Wii U gamepad didn't start acting up until after 4.5 years of owning it, while my first right joy con started acting up after 5-6 months of ownership.My PS4 Dualshock had right joystick drifting .... and I bought the damn thing in December .... have experienced the Joy-con drift too.Is it seriously THAT prevalent of an issue? I have 4 sets of Joycons and haven't had the issue. But maybe that's why, as they all get less use.This is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for. I have a solution for Drift. Take better care of your hardware. I've had three pairs since launch and they all work flawlessly. Something tells me that there's a reason why Nintendo hasnt addressed the drifting issue and it's because those who experience it are a vocal minority. The majority of Joy-cons most likely work fine.I hope Nintendo ignores this. The Internet is full of whiners and I'm tired of them causing trouble for something they're actually responsible for.@TheAwesomeBowser I couldn't resist bringing out Phoenix for something like this.  Wonderful Simpsons reference.Only for US citizens?I pop in from time to time. About time.... Before someone else wallet bleeds for expensive joy-cons brought due to unknown drifting origin.Since production moved to China build quality has gone way down hill. Remember when 1st party controllers were built to last and take a beating? Even wireless controllers lasted because they took disposable batteries. Now the whole controller is disposable.I no longer use 2 of my left joycons due to this issue. One takes 1-2 secs to register movements while the other goes all the way left every 30 secs or so. On joycon pair 3 now.All of my joycon have developed drifting issues. Decided not to buy anymore until they do a hardware fix.Yes sadly I have experianced this. My left joycon kept drifting and I tried just about every solution I could find to fix it untill I eventualy gave up and bought a new set.I hope it does not happen again.I'm still using the joy-cons that came with my switch on launch day and they've given me no trouble.However, I bought a back-up pair to use instead of the ones that came with my switch, and the right joy-con from that pair drifts sharply down, making playing pretty much any game where you have to aim impossible(DooM, Ziggurat, Red Faction Guerrilla, etc). I'd say this is definitely an issue.Good. Hopefully this pressures Nintendo to fix this issue, and pays some of those people back, that have had to replace/repair many sets. On my third set personally.This is a real problem!I keep my controllers in perfect condition and still use my original Wavebirds.The 3 left launch day joy cons I have all exhibit this issue. The two I bought since are fine.I've always said Nintendo hardware is much better than of the shelf brands.Not this time! I've been calling these things junk since a few months after they came out (check my posts!)I had to fix my left analogic joycon. Why? Because it fall in the ground and after it, the problem beggined. I bet all people with the same problem, it happened, but few will be honests about it.
What happens is which the joycons are really tiny and economic to allow came two with the console.
Gamecube controls and others was robust to be able suport impact but was a lot bigger. The joycon was made tiny to allow a good portability. Want a controler more resistant? Buy a pro controler.@EchoNemesis I know this is super off-topic, but from what anime is your avatar? The art style reminds me of Tenchi Muyo, and I was just wondering. Thanks in advance! (Also, in the interest of relevance, I hafta google what this whole "drift" thing is all about - I've only ever used my switch in either handheld or docked with the Pro Controller and so I'm not sure what it all means.)@PhilKenSebben Harvey Birdman is (in my experience) a very underappreciated work. Good on you, Internet Sir.Nintendo don't just need to acknowledge this is a problem, they need to fix it, and they need to compensate anyone who is out of pocket for their poor quality/design fault. And they need to be punished to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.I say this as a massive Nintendo fan, and as someone who hasn't had any drift issues. But corporations need to be held responsible for their mis-actions.It’s not just the joy-con. I’ve experienced it with a pro controller as well.Drifting can happen on any controller.I have had no drift problems with mine I got on day 1. Is this an issue with switches bought recently (past year or so)?My left joy con drifts extremely to the left. It began happening about a month after my warranty expired so I just didn't mess with it and bought a procontrollerHasn’t affected me but it seems very widespread and I hope Nintendo are forced to do something about this. Sticking their head in the sand does them no credit.Had to send in my (launch system) L-Joycon for repair twice and it was handled within warranty by Nintendo (in the Netherlands).First time was for the sync issue which was acknowledged by Nintendo. Unfortunately within approx. 1 year after this repair the stick started drifting upwards and it only got worse as time passed. It got to the point where I couldn't play games with it anymore. Called Nintendo, they told me to send it in and they replaced the stick.I never had to rely on warranty or repairs for any of my consoles and I've been gaming since the NES came out. The N64 sticks were bad (still working though) but only long after the GCN came out did I buy some replacement sticks for the N64 controllers because I wanted them in good condition. I'm also relatively careful with my electronics and keep everything in good condition and in a clean environment.I definitely think there is a design flaw of the sticks or joycons that is causing drifiting issues. I hope Nintendo will be forced to acknowledge the issue and send out replacement Joycons for people with the issue. It sucks for a company and costs a lot of money but they should have selected better quality parts if it really is the stick as many suspect.Finaly Nintendo needs to confirm this.All the years I have Nintendo consoles, and controllers never had issues.Both of my joycons are drifting, have been for months now.@Agramonte I'm so glad you mentioned that, as that controller is the exact thing I've been looking for for ages. I hate the current Joy Cons for 2D games (because of the lack of an actual D-pad), and for 3D games that use the second analog stick a lot, as it's in such an uncomfortable position. This solves both problems, and on top of that also has bigger buttons and bigger real estate, so it seems much more ergonomic all around. Thanks so much for the heads up!Yeah, mine do this too. They aren’t even used much because I have a Pro Controller, and somehow they have this issue. Calibration sometimes works but it’s always temporary so for portable play I just stick to tabletop with the Pro.It is so strange that a PS Vita (Fat model) has same small joysticks didn't have the issue but the Switch has.After seeing a video about joy-con analogs that Spawn Wave made I facepalmed but was also very angry, in the end Nintendo used the wrong (cheap) materials in the analog of the joy-con that make it wear off anyhow and quickly, in other words every joy-con analog will someday end up with drift because of that.And now with the Switch Lite and the lack of replacable joy-cons that could become a huge issue and it's main flaw.I for one am shocked that such a critical error could happen with all the assumed quality control. It’s unfortunate. Hopefully the newer joycons have been revised.Where do I sing or how can I fill the form.Please!My original joy cons and my pro controller suffer from drift. I would love to get some money back from Nintendo for this.I can’t imagine how anyone could want the switch lite and not be worried that once the joy cons start drifting that they have to buy a brand new systemI need to watch a video on this I have no idea what you all are talking about.WD40 Contact Cleaner - worked for me. Compressed air didn't work, so after scouring the Internet that was my best option. Have already sent them back before (laughing at the 'take better care of your hardware!' comments. Take better care of your attitude), so was going to buy new ones thought what the heck, and ta-da.Will they start drifting again? Probably if it is the actual contact points that have worn / flaked through, but I suggest you give it a try. Power off first please.My right JoyCon drifts, why Nintendo didn’t stick with the Circle Pad’s is a mystery.We have a stick that I fixed for a few months but it came back.I can only guess it's the build quality of the sticks themselves. I don't understand those that say it is dust though as they have dust covers?Like some users mentioned above, desynching and recalibrating over and over after also doing the usual is what helped me the first time.I'm wondering if it's a mix of quality and software?@MH4 EVERYONE I've talked to with a switch, minus one, has experienced drift.i have the launch model and i have not exerince this drifting issue, maybe im not playing hardcore on my joycons or not put in too many hours for it to trigger idk,so ya have to forgive me if i find this a bit suspicious to have a class action lawsuit if the majority of nonissues outweighs the issuesHas anyone signed that thing for the law suit attorneys to look at? Because I want to know if I should do it or just buy the new joycons coming out in October.

If you’ve been anywhere near Facebook or Twitter in the past several months, you’re probably aware that there is a case working its way through the courts that accuses Donald Trump of raping a 13-year-old girl in 1994.On Wednesday, the woman, who remains anonymous, was slated to appear at a press conference with her new attorney, Lisa Bloom, the daughter of Gloria Allred. Bloom wrote a column about the case in The Huffington Post last summer.BREAKING: woman who sued Donald Trump for child rape breaks her silence today. https://t.co/ecbzZ6jxSU pic.twitter.com/kdCRsG7wImFor months, people have wondered why this case isn’t getting more ― or, really, any ― attention in the press, even now that Trump faces an actual court date: a Dec. 16 status conference with the judge.  The allegations aren’t entirely implausible on their face. The accuser says Trump raped her repeatedly at parties thrown by since-convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who was widely known to throw wild parties with young women and girls. Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and served a small portion of an 18-year sentence.In a New York magazine profile of Epstein before he went to prison, and long before Trump ran for president, Trump acknowledged that he knows Epstein. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,’’ Trump says in the story. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it ― Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”The lawsuit against Trump includes affidavits from two anonymous women who say they were witnesses. Yet there’s been little coverage of the case. As one of the media outlets that has not published much about it, I can say there are two main reasons we shied away. The accuser in this case is anonymous, and the suit is filed under a pseudonym in New York. A previous case filed in California used the name “Katie Johnson.” To accuse someone in print of forcibly raping a child is about as serious a charge as can be made. To do that with an anonymous accuser would be an extraordinary step, putting the journalist’s reputation on the line. One senior national reporter who has covered both campaigns said that the anonymity was the main stumbling block. “If it’s something that’s this damaging to a candidate, you better be sure, and she’s anonymous,” the reporter said, asking for anonymity to talk openly about the decision-making process. “Look, if she came out and she would do an interview, that would be different, but she’s an anonymous plaintiff.”To go forward with an anonymous source shifts responsibility for the veracity of the claims from the accuser to the reporter. If the person is named and on record, the reporter can argue that he or she is merely reporting what the person is saying, and people are free to believe her or not. But giving anonymity says something different to an audience. It suggests, I, as a journalist, have investigated this person and these charges, and find them sufficiently credible to bring them forward without a name attached. Especially in the wake of the Rolling Stone fiasco, that requires an extreme amount of confidence in the source.And the way the case rolled out did not inspire that confidence. One of the leading organizers of the effort to get the press to pay attention to this case is Steve Baer, an outspoken Republican donor. Baer last made news when his effort to out an alleged affair between Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) contributed to McCarthy dropping his bid to become House speaker. Baer’s style is to liberally cc and bcc an endless stream of powerful people, and it usually has the effect of getting none of them to listen. When I wrote to him Monday night, for instance, to say I was going to write a story on why the media were avoiding the child rape story, he replied and cc’ed Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron, along with a host of other media figures. And Baer, in fact, is among the more credible advocates the accuser has going for her. The accuser initially filed the case on her own behalf in California, but it was tossed for not stating an articulable violation of her civil rights. The case has since been refiled in New York, under the representation of a patent lawyer named Thomas Meagher. A patent lawyer handling the case hasn’t inspired the most confidence. (He didn’t respond to a request for comment.)The least credible backer has to be a man who may or may not be named Al Taylor, but is more likely named Norm Lubow, and was apparently a former producer for “The Jerry Springer Show.”Media outlets that have tried to get in touch with Johnson have had extreme difficulty doing so. The Daily Beast did a deep dive into the case and the people supporting the accuser in July, and came to a devastating conclusion: “Far from derailing the Trump train, Katie Johnson and her supporters seem to be in an out-of-control clown car whose wheels just came off,” wrote Brandy Zadrozny.The Guardian and Jezebel also looked into the situation and came up with equally unfavorable takes. A writer who actually talked to Johnson came away confused about what to make of the allegations. It’s unclear if anybody has managed to speak to Tiffany Doe or Joan Doe, the two witnesses cited in the case. “Jezebel, The Guardian and The Daily Beast effectively poisoned the well on Katie’s credibility,” Baer lamented to HuffPost, accurately.If you’re still struggling to understand why the story didn’t get more coverage, imagine for a moment that you’re a reporter thinking about spending weeks looking into it. Then go read the Daily Beast article. Still ready to go down that rabbit hole? But as the reality of the court date increasingly dawns on the press, coupled with Trump’s own admission that he sexually assaults women, the case is getting harder to ignore. Baer said that two media outlets have recently done interviews with Johnson, and stories could pop at any minute.  Erik Wemple, a media reporter at The Washington Post, said he hasn’t talked to many journalists about their decision to shy away from the story. “I can’t cover everything,” he said. “Around the spring, the Washington Post was getting hammered for assigning two dozen reporters to investigate Trump. I wrote a piece wondering whether that was anywhere near enough. It wasn’t, as it turns out.” In some ways, given the role of Facebook in disseminating news, it matters less this cycle than any other previous one that the media have largely ignored the case. Open platforms, too, have helped the story circulate. The story that Bloom published on HuffPost’s contributor platform has been shared on Facebook 140,000 times. The piece has been viewed 5,221,475 times since June.With Bloom’s planned press conference on Wednesday, things might have changed. But Johnson’s appearance was canceled at the last minute because Bloom said her client had received threats and was afraid of appearing in public.Press conference cancelled, Jane Doe has received numerous threats, afraid to show her face. -Lisa BloomBloom: "We're going to have to reschedule.

A fuel switch from coal to gas cut emissions from German fossil fuel power plants by a third in June 2019 as compared to the same month the year before. Lower gas prices and higher costs for CO2 allowances are part of the explanation. [UPDATE adds comments by Karsten Capion, senior advisor at Danish Energy on Carbon Brief]German fossil fuel power plants emitted 33 percent less CO2 in June 2019 compared to the same month last year due to a market-driven “fuel switch” from coal to gas, according to solar energy research institute Fraunhofer ISE. The switch was caused by low gas prices combined with a rise in the cost of CO2 allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and lower exchange electricity prices caused by a boom in renewables, among other factors. Simply put, generating electricity from lignite became more expensive than the alternative, gas. Some market analysts said the switch may continue in the coming months.“Since January, we have seen the high carbon price really making the perfect market for gas,” said Yan Qin, lead carbon analyst at Refinitiv, on the developments in Germany. “We really see an interesting phenomenon: in the daily German power market, a high carbon price and very low gas price is really pushing gas in front of lignite,” she told Clean Energy Wire.Over the last year, the average cost of CO2 allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System have risen by 65 percent – from an average of 15 euros per tonne of CO2 in June 2018 to 25 euros per tonne in June 2019. According to Qin, the price hike is a result of the newly implemented Market Stability Reserve, a mechanism which cuts oversupply of CO2 allowances on the market. This has had further effects. “Participants in the EU ETS – power companies and industrials – are becoming more aware of the high carbon cost,” says Qin. “They are becoming more active in carbon risk management and in buying allowances.”The fuel switch from coal to gas comes at a time when the German government is in negotiations with coal mining and power generation operators such as RWE about shutting down power plants in line with the recommendations of the coal exit commission. The commission had proposed to end coal-fired power production in Germany by 2038 at the latest, and the government must now decide on the recommendation’s implementation. Negotiations also include the possibility of compensation payments to operators once their facilities are taken off the grid in the framework of Germany’s coal exit plan.Due to the fuel switch in Germany, net electricity generation from lignite fell by 38 percent in June 2018 compared to June 2019, while power generation from hard coal fell by 41 percent, according to Fraunhofer ISE. Gas-fired power plants, on the other hand, increased their production by 62 percent. Weather conditions meant that electricity generation from wind rose by 14 percent while solar electricity generation rose by 21 percent. Lower electricity consumption contributed to the fall in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants.In the case of electricity generation in Germany, not only lignite but also hard coal fell to a new low in June. A comparison with previous years shows the dramatic crash:June 2019: 2.58 TWhJune 2018: 4.36 TWhJune 2017: 4.71 TWhJune 2016: 8.19 TWhhttps://t.co/YYkDDSnbPb pic.twitter.com/GV0BA7RqCFProfessor Bruno Burger at Fraunhofer ISE called the drop in CO2 emissions a “gratifying side-effect” of “purely market-driven events”. Germany’s total greenhouse gas emissions from power production have also decreased in 2019 so far. During the first half of the year, greenhouse gas emissions fell by 15 percent, compared to the same period in 2018, as reported by the German energy industry association BDEW. The total drop in CO2 emissions was also attributed to a record in renewables, rising CO₂ allowance prices and mild weather.Refinitiv estimates that the German fuel switch will “continue at full speed in the next few months” as most gas analytics still estimate that European gas prices will remain at a low at least until autumn.More long term, Refinitiv’s power model of Germany shows that the first phase of the German phase-out of coal-fired power generation, which will collide with the final phase of the country’s nuclear exit, could make German power supply “a bit tight in 2021-22”. This could also mean more work for existing gas plants during the time period. The German government aims to raise the share of renewables to 65 percent by 2030 as part of its Energiewende drive to replace fossil and nuclear power generation.In a guest post on British Carbon Brief, senior advisor at Danish Energy Karsten Capion says that “lignite generation could rebound in the short term” in Germany as gas prices are expected to rise again and competition from nuclear power generation will be phased out. But the cost advantage of running a lignite-fired power plant as opposed to a gas-fired one “seems set to remain small”. Coupled with an expected rapid growth in renewable power generation, “the end for German coal could arrive sooner than expected”, concludes Capion.All Factsheets ›All Dossiers ›Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 210178 Berlin, GermanyResearching a story?

Iran’s deputy foreign minister is “worried” the United States might have shot down its own drone by mistake over the Persian Gulf on July 18, as he insisted Iran has not lost any of its own drones.Abbas Araghchi (Araqchi) tweeted on July 19 that "We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] by mistake!"U.S. President Donald Trump announced a day earlier that it had brought down an Iranian drone flying too close to its warship and took defensive action. The Pentagon clarified that it had used a jamming system to “destroy” the flying object instead of using conventional weapons such as anti-aircraft guns or missiles.There have not been any other official reactions from Iran to the U.S. statements about the Iranian drone.Iran has been boasting for years that it is capable of using drones to fly over U.S. naval vessels and has even published videos saying they were filmed by drones flying over U.S. ships.Last month Iran also shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the same area, but president Trump decided not to retaliate at the time.

Footage of the crash shared on social media showed the vehicles slamming into bystanders at the charity event on the A602 in Hertfordshire last nightAt least 14 people have been hurt after two 'boy racers' ploughed into crowds of youngsters at a car meet in Stevenage.Footage of the crash shared on social media showed the vehicles slamming into bystanders at the charity event on the A602 in Hertfordshire.Witnesses said they saw 'kids lying everywhere' as rescue services rushed to the scene.Pictures of the aftermath showed a huge emergency response, with police confirming that 14 people were injured, some seriously, and 12 people were taken to hospital.Ciaran O'Connor, 33, who witnessed the crash while driving home from an open mic night, said he saw three or four youngsters lying motionless in the road.Did you see what happened? Email webnews@mirror.co.ukHe told Mirror Online: "You could just see kids on the floor not moving. I saw at least 10 people injured. One boy had quite a bad arm injury."Another boy had his arm cut open and his mum was really upset. She came 15 minutes after the incident and grabbed him and hugged him."The first car hit three or four people. I think the slow car went into eight to nine people but it was going slow."There were about 200 people there. The majority of them were 15, 16 or 17."Mr O'Connor said he saw a car travelling at speed hit a group of youngsters.He added: "They went flying. A car pulled out of a retail park and this other car... basically dodged it and took these kids out."The crash took place at around 9.45pm during a weekly meet of the modified car club Cruise Herts.It is not yet clear whether members of the club were involved in the smash.One witness said: "My thoughts and prayers are with all those poor kids who were struck by a car tonight in Stevenage at the car meet."Literally never seen a scene like it. Kids lying in the road everywhere missed it by about 10 seconds as was just turning round the roundabout."Another witness added: "I was also there and spent over an hour holding one of the girls while the paramedics turned up."I was sat on the grass bank and then moved across the road and sat on the other side approximately five minutes before it happened."It may have been a decision that save me and my son. I hope the two injured girls I was with recover along with all the other injured parties."The collision took place near a Wickes DIY store on the A602 as one car pulled out of Roaring Meg South car park onto the road.At least 30 members of the emergency services are at the scene, according to witnesses.In the distressing footage shared on social media, a car can be seen hurtling past another vehicle before mounting the curb and hitting spectators.It sent the slower-moving car ploughing into another group of people on the other side of the road. A major incident has been declared at Lister Hospital in Stevenage as emergency services deal with the casualties.A helicopter is reported to have arrived at the scene as casualties are taken to hospital. The car meet was described on Facebook as an 'extra special meet' to raise money for families affected by stillbirth and miscarriage. On the Cruise-Herts Facebook page, a post read: "This Thursday night meet is an extra special meet we as a group are raising money for the excellent charity of 4Louis who help supporting families through the heartache of miscarriage stillbirth and child loss."This is a Strictly Static Meet & Any Antisocial Behaviour Will Not be Tolerated! Any Such Behaviour will be Dealt with by the Local Authorities!! So strictly NO Wheel Spins NO Burnouts and NO Drifting."A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: "Police and other emergency service colleagues are currently at the scene of a serious road traffic collision on Monkswood Way Stevenage."Two cars were involved in the collision which occurred at around 9.45pm. There were a number of people in the area at the time and 14 people are being are presently being treated for injuries, some of which are serious."Officers from the Beds, Cambs and Herts road policing unit are investigating and emergency services are expected to remain at the scene for some time."Police are looking to speak to anyone with footage of the incident.A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: "Twelve people have been taken to three hospitals including the Lister Hospital in Stevenage."

Brendt Christensen received the life term after a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on whether he should be given the death penalty.Christensen, 30, abducted Yingying Zhang on the university campus in June 2017 before beating her to death with a baseball bat and decapitating her.Her remains have never been found.Ms Zhang's parents and fiance had attended the five-week trial in Peoria, south-west of Chicago.The proceedings have been followed closely in China, which sent consular officials to Thursday's hearing.Handing down the sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release, US District Judge James Shadid said Christensen's actions were "an inexplicable act of violence".He said the Zhang family might never learn where their daughter's remains rested."Whatever self-centred opinion you have of yourself, when you are taken out of here today by the United States marshals, to wait for that lonely, isolated and cold deathbed that follows your natural life in prison, maybe, just maybe, the moment will strike you to pick up paper and pen and write 'I'm sorry' to Mr and Mrs Zhang," he said, according to the Chicago Tribune.Christensen did not speak during the hearing.Afterwards, Zhang's father, Ronggao Zhang, said the family would "not have peace or closure" until her remains were found."If you have any humanity left in your soul, please help us end our torment," said a family statement addressed to Christensen.John Milhiser, US attorney for the Central District of Illinois, told a news conference that efforts to find the student's remains would continue.The court had heard how Zhang, 26, disappeared in Champaign, a city about 135 miles (200km) south of Chicago, barely two months after coming to the US.She had been on her way to sign a lease for an apartment when Christensen posed as an undercover police officer to coax her into his car. Surveillance footage captured the abduction.The trial was told that Christensen had approached another young woman earlier on the same day but she refused to get into his vehicle.Christensen's former girlfriend, Terra Bullis, testified that he had confessed to the murder to her while they attended a vigil for the missing student.Ms Bullis said she agreed to wear a hidden microphone for the FBI in order to record her conversations with Christensen.Jurors heard the secretly taped audio in which Christensen describes in detail how he sexually assaulted Zhang, killed and decapitated her. He also told of her "valiant" attempt to fight back.Although Illinois has abolished capital punishment, Christensen was charged in federal court, which had made him eligible for the death penalty.The case has been closely watched in China. On Chinese social media site Weibo, the hashtag "Murderer of Zhang gets life imprisonment" received over 400 million views.Many were enraged that Christensen did not receive the death penalty."A great injustice has been done," said one commenter on Weibo. "The sentence shows the inadequacy of the jury.""The jury has given Christensen a chance to escape death," said another commenter. "Unfortunately, Zhang never got such a chance."Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world


 President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign is thirsty for some donations.  So much so that it's selling some laser-engraved, Trump-branded straws on it's campaign  website. In a brief description, the campaign appears to take a jab at environmentally-conscious people.  "Liberal paper straws don't work," the item description said. "STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today."  The 9-inch straws are sold in a pack of 10 for $15. The campaign claims they are BPA free, "reusable & recyclable," and are made in the US.  The website doesn't specifically list what the straws are made of, however, if Trump's son had any role in the straws' development, chances are they are not made of paper.  "Paper Straws Suck #Trump2020," Donald Trump Jr.  tweeted in June.  According to a  World Economic Forum report, plastics in the ocean will outweigh fish by 2050, and around 500 million plastic straws are thrown away by Americans,  WIRED reported in 2016. One marine environmental group  estimated in 2017 that straws and stirrers were the seventh-most collected trash on beaches.                                                                                              Straws are regularly incapable of being recycled, because of their small size they often slip right off the conveyor belts of recycling plants, according to WIRED.  Following the warnings from numerous environmentalist groups, companies that regularly use single-use straws and stir sticks — including Starbucks, Disney, and numerous airlines — vowed to replace them with eco-friendly straws or recyclable lids. 


Demonstrations against Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló  turned violent again overnight, as thousands took to the streets calling for his resignation. Backlash is intensifying over a profane and derogatory group chat that targeted people critical of his administration. And while protesters marched through San Juan last night, the investigative group that leaked the messages alleged that there's a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal behind the chats.  On the street outside the governor's mansion, thousands of demonstrators clashed with riot police. At least one protester lit a Molotov cocktail.When fireworks went off behind the police barricade, officers decided to go on the offensive, firing tear gas and pushing the crowd to disperse them. It's unclear who set off the fireworks.Rosselló insists he has no plans to leave his role. But demonstrators say they're not going anywhere, either: earlier in the day, more than 75,000 protesters marched near the Capitol."We are so, so pissed with the government," demonstrator Carmen Ponet told "CBS This Morning" lead national correspondent David Begnaud.  Puerto Rican celebrities flew to the island to lead the rally, including actor Benicio del Toro and singer Ricky Martin, who is one of the people targeted in the governor's group chat.  "We're tired of cynicism. They put down women, they put down the LGBT community, people with disabilities. Corruption. It is insane…" Martin said. "It's pretty much barbaric what he's doing. We're tired. And we're angry."    As they marched, news broke from the island's Center for Investigative Journalism, the group which published the leaked conversations on Saturday. Their new report alleges a multi-billion dollar corruption network is behind the group chat, where public funds were used to influence and benefit private clients and the Puerto Rican government. It also claims Rosselló  knew -- and did nothing to stop it.  This came as no surprise to Puerto Ricans who have long criticized Rosselló's handling of Hurricane Maria, and the bankrupt island's recovery from the worst financial crisis in its history. "This is just an example of what is happening," said demonstrator Ileana Rivera. "The difference now is that we know because of that chat. That's why we are here... now we know…how they work and how they use our money."The governor's office said in a statement that Rosselló has handed over any evidence he has of corruption to the proper authorities. Puerto Rico's Department of Justice has ordered all 12 people involved in the leaked chat, including Rosselló, to deliver their cell phones for inspection over the next few days.Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the our 24/7 digital news network.

She then worked for Google as its head of global development initiatives from 2007 to 2009.The hiring comes as Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, struggles to stake out a clear niche for himself in a crowded Democratic field featuring a number of high-profile progressives.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the leading progressives in the crowded Democratic field, have made waves by criticizing Big Tech and the major banks.Warren has proposed a plan to break up major tech firms like Google and Apple. Sanders proudly lists the  "anti-endorsements " of banking executives on his website, including one from former Goldman chief Lloyd Blankfein.For years, Goldman has been a toxic brand for those on the left, blamed for exacerbating the 2008 financial crisis and for wielding disproportionate influence in the economic policies of both major parties. In 2019, the country's largest tech firms have become the new boogeymen.In a statement, Buttigieg's national press secretary, Chris Meagher, said that while at Goldman, Shah  "wasn't involved in any deals nor did she benefit from any deals." "She developed and managed Goldman Sachs' environmental strategy. She trained bankers to ask environmental questions, managed the grants to non-profits, and worked with their real estate team on how to build more green buildings," he said.In contribution records filed with the Federal Election Commission from the period, Shah listed her occupation at varying times as an  "investment banker," "economist" and "vice president."In early 2017, Shah cheered President Donald Trump's hiring of Goldman executive Dina Powell, first as an economic assistant and later as deputy national security adviser. "Great choice. Dina Powell will be great. Trump hires another executive from Goldman Sachs," Shah wrote in a Twitter post.At Google, Meagher said, she was  "only involved in the philanthropy side of Google, not the company side. At the time she worked there, Google.org had a separate team that was focused on grants and social impact."The campaign emphasized Shah's time working as deputy assistant to the president and as director of the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation during the Obama administration. "She worked at the Obama White House after the financial crisis. She doesn't advocate for companies — she cares about having the greatest social impact for people, and finding new solutions to tough challenges that require the public, private, and social sectors to work together to find them," Meagher said. "That's why she is teaching at Georgetown after leaving the White House."At Georgetown, Shah was a professor and the founder of the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation. That center was founded with a $10 million donation from investor Alberto Beeck, a former Lehman Brothers investment banker who is now focused on the mining, hotels, wealth management, telecom and tech sectors, according to an online biography. "On Georgetown - the money was given to Georgetown. She was hired by Georgetown. The center equips students with tools and approaches to further the common good," Meagher said.The hire follows Buttigieg's blockbuster fundraising quarter in which he raised more than any other Democratic candidate. He's since been continuing to fill out his campaign staff.Now Buttigieg is seeking to turn that fundraising heft into support from voters. The 37-year-old has been stagnant in the polls since former Vice president Joe Biden entered the race in late April. The millennial mayor is currently in fifth place, according to recent polls.Also Thursday, the campaign announced the hiring of Jess O'Connell, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee, to become a senior advisor.Got a confidential news tip?

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd of Democratic activists Thursday that it has taken the United States more than two centuries to elect an outspoken group of minority women to Congress and that “we will not go back.”Speaking at a rally in suburban Maryland, Ocasio-Cortez did not refer directly to President Trump, who this week used Twitter to portray the freshman lawmaker from the Bronx — and three other first-term House Democrats — as unpatriotic leftists who should return to their countries of origin.“It has taken us 240 years to have this unique composite in the Congress, in this moment, and we will not go back,” Ocasio-Cortez told more than 700 cheering Democrats at the Silver Spring Civic Center. “We will not go back to the days of injustice. We will not go back; we will go forward. But we sure as hell will not stand still.”The rally was a benefit for “Democracy Summer,” a program that Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) started more than a decade ago to train new generations of Democratic activists.Raskin isn’t accustomed to drawing big crowds when he hosts fundraisers for the program. But after his office announced Ocasio-Cortez’s appearance last week, his phone began to ring endlessly.Within hours, all 700 tickets were gone, and his office had to start a waiting list.“Usually I’m the attraction, which tells you about our comparative popular appeal,” Raskin said before the rally. Referring to Ocasio-Cortez’s star power, he said, “She makes news when she gets a cup of water.”The lawmakers Trump targeted — Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) — are all women of color. Omar, a refu­gee from Somalia, is the only one born outside the United States. She returned home to Minneapolis Thursday from Washington, and was greeted at the airport by enthusiastic crowds.Ocasio-Cortez received a similar hero’s welcome at the civic center, in the heart of Raskin’s deep-blue district just outside the District. “It has been a kind of crazy week, hasn’t it?” she said as she began her remarks.“America has always been the story of those fighting to advance the rights of others,” she continued. “And some, clinging to the past, to preserve the rights of a few.”Hundreds of people stood in long security lines in the stifling heat to get a glimpse of the 29-year-old Democrat. A choir sang folk songs as they waited.“She speaks very profoundly for the millennials my age coming from immigrant backgrounds,” said Samantha Labastida, 23, a child-care provider from Wheaton. “She’s the voice we have been yearning for.”A few feet away, Tynan Jackson, 23, an Ohioan who is interning in Washington for the summer, said it’s Ocasio-Cortez’s background as a political neophyte that attracts him. “She’s an outsider like Trump, but with her it’s a positive,” he said. “She doesn’t have any money, she’s from the Bronx, and she canvassed in shoes that whittled to the sole. She’s genuine.”But Jim Greenberg, a retired academic administrator who described himself as a pragmatist, said he worries that Ocasio-Cortez’s “bombastic” criticism of establishment Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.) would harm the party.“It gives Trump and the Republicans ammunition,” he said. “She voices things at times that are not helpful to our side of the coin — the blue side.”Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest person ever elected to Congress in November when she won her seat representing a district that stretches from the Bronx to Queens. She had ousted 10-term incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary, a victory that was widely regarded as the most surprising upset in the 2018 midterm elections.She has remained a force since taking office, pressing a progressive platform that includes Medicare-for-all, free public college, and a “Green New Deal” to address climate change and economic inequality.Ocasio-Cortez and her three colleagues, who are collectively known as “The Squad” on Capitol Hill, have tangled with fellow Democrats, including Pelosi, who has portrayed them as marginal players in Washington.Raskin — who works with Ocasio-Cortez as the chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties — predicted when he introduced her Thursday night that she would be “one of the greatest members of the Congress of the 21st century.”He described her victorious campaign as a “historic inspiration.”When it was her turn, Ocasio-Cortez returned the favor, saying Raskin was the kind of lawmaker she was hoping to find when she reached Washington — “voraciously intellectual” and “able to quote Jefferson at the drop of a dime.”She went on to describe the United States as rooted in dualities — “the good and bad, America is the hope and despair.”After her remarks, she joined a chorus in singing Woody Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land,” then elicited a few squeals from onlookers when she waved before slipping out a back door.At the crowd departed, Paul Weidorn, 63, a high school teacher who lives in Severna Park, said he was impressed by her words and passion.But he said that Ocasio-Cortez needs more than just heated rhetoric.“It all sounds great, but how do you turn it into something that happens?” he asked. “When you get down to the nuts and bolts, how do you turn it into legislation?”Read more:Fact Checker: Four Pinocchios for Trump’s claim he tried to stop chantThe Fix: The Democrats Trump attacked are the ones his base despises mostA divided U.S. House condemns President Trump’s attacks on congresswomenLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)Like PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news


When Congressman Al Green’s Trump impeachment resolution was tabled by the House yesterday, coverage of the incident focused on the fact that more Democrats (95) had voted for it than in Green’s past efforts. It was brushed aside, though, because (depending on how you look at it) Democrats weren’t ready to move in that direction or will never be ready, unless something really new about Trump pops up. I understand, and to a considerable extent, share Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s reluctance to stake the entire 2020 election on a dumpster dive into the details of the Mueller investigation and incidents of presidential obstruction of justice. And it wasn’t surprising that many House Democrats who are at least open to impeachment might want to wait until next week’s Mueller testimony before reaching any conclusions on the path ahead.But then I read Green’s resolution, and its single article of impeachment, and discovered it’s not about obstruction of justice or collusion with Russia or violation of the emoluments clause or contempt for the rule of law or any of the other long list of particulars we’ve heard so much about as possible grounds for putting the 45th president in the dock, literally or figuratively. No — it’s about the latest and clearest evidence that Trump is a disgusting bigot:The House of Representatives on July 16, 2019 strongly condemned President Donald Trump’s racist comments that have legitimatized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants and those who may look to the president like immigrants, should go back to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as invaders. And by saying that members of Congress who are immigrants or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants, do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America.In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has by his statement, brought the high office of the President of the United States in contempt, ridiculed, disgraced and disrepute, has sown seeds of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be president and has betrayed his trust as President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. And has committed a high misdemeanor in office.No need to grill Robert Mueller, or battle with the Justice Department for documents, or bone up on constitutional or criminal law, to put forward that proposition, is there? If there was any doubt of the president’s willingness to espouse, endorse, and campaign upon the deliberate encouragement of racial resentments, he has removed it this week. So from that perspective, Green’s resolution was not a moment premature, but instead perfectly timed.Unlike an impeachment resolution focused on the murky doings of Trump and his campaign and his staff and assorted sordid associates in days long past, Green’s would not risk being a distraction from the case against the president’s reelection that Democrats will inevitably make anyway. How can you possibly tell Americans why they should deny this man a second term in office without confronting his evil nature, his malignant character, and his relentless efforts to divide the country and heap contempt on the most vulnerable (or as Trump would call them, the losers) among us? How can it fail to “normalize” his behavior if his critics once again protest for a day or two and then change the subject to health care or the minimum wage or Iran or who said what to whom as Mueller’s hounds lurked nearby?Yes, I know there are actual bigots out there who love Trump for his hate-filled tweets and rants but who might yet be persuaded to vote against him if they are shown he has broken his lying promises to them or that he’s up to his neck in alligators even as he pretends to “drain the swamp.” But we should realize this week, if not before, that none of these efforts to surgically detach Trump voters from him with tweezers and rubbing alcohol are going to work. The president will always drag political discourse right down into the gutter with him, because it’s what he does best. It’s how he beat Hillary Clinton, and it’s how he intends to slither across the finish line again in 2020. Of course, Democrats need to promote their own agenda and provide the clearest possible alternative path ahead for the country. But at the same time, they have to make it unmistakably clear that all these things we tend to slough off as Trump’s “style” and “M.O.” and “tactics” — the rotten racist core of his message and its fascistic trappings as well –– are unacceptable as a matter of principle and patriotism. Otherwise Trump — and if not Trump, certainly Trumpism — wins.A doomed impeachment effort (doomed by a Republican Party whose leaders are privately horrified by Trump even as they publicly rationalize his pathologies and flatter his limitless vanity) may still not be the right course of action for Democrats. But one way or another, focusing on his unchanging character is a surer path ahead than perpetually hoping that the next rock overturned — whether it’s the Mueller report, or the census litigation, or the Epstein prosecution — will finally reveal the unimpeachable truth about Donald Trump. We already know the most dangerous things he’s done to respect for decency, for honesty, and for each other as human beings. We already know he’s corrupted one of our two major political parties with the powerful drug of white nationalism, and seduced millions of earnest conservative Christians to abandon love for anger and the Golden Rule for guns and cages. If this is to blame the symptom rather than the cause, so be it: Whatever devilish moral virus Trump represents, it must be confronted. Al Green offered one way to do that, and a majority of House Democrats declined it. Let’s hope they haven’t simply grown numb.At least the Republican Party isn’t running with Trump’s rhetoricIt’s the kumbaya party nowLeaders of House Democratic factions riven by weeks of infighting pledged to unify on Thursday, with each side deleting recent social media posts attacking each other.In a joint statement issued Thursday, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.), New Democrat Coalition Chair Rep. Derek Kilmer (Wash.) and Blue Dog Coalition Chair Rep. Stephanie Murphy (Fla.) downplayed recent divisions over strategy and policy priorities.“House Democrats are a diverse, robust and passionate family. We love our country and are dedicated to making life better for everyday Americans. At times, there may be different perspectives on the way forward. That is a hallmark of the legislative process,” the joint statement reads. Good one, RandHow will Iran respond?Mayor Pete’s getting some help from HollywoodAmong the more than 50 celebrities who gave Buttigieg money during the second quarter are rocker Joan Jett ($150), recording industry mogul David Geffen ($5,600), fashion icon Anna Wintour ($2,800), designer Tom Ford ($5,600), actress Sharon Stone ($5,600) and comedian Ellen DeGeneres ($5,600). They helped fuel his field-leading $24.8 million fundraising haul.Donny, you’re out of your elementActor Steve Buscemi donated the maximum amount possible to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) presidential election campaign.The actor known for his roles in The Death of Stalin and The Big Lebowski gave $2,800 to the mayor in June, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filing.But there will be no further chargesSearch warrants made public Thursday show that the FBI believed then-candidate Donald Trump spoke with his attorney Michael Cohen and aide Hope Hicks during the 2016 campaign about silencing news stories related to his alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels.Why it matters: The Southern District of New York’s investigation into hush money payments, which has now concluded, resulted in Cohen being sentenced to prison for three years for campaign finance violations. Trump — who was previously referred to in court documents as “Individual 1” — has denied allegations of his involvement in the scheme.This is what the Mooch gets for not being completely reprehensibleThe Palm Beach County GOP disinvited Anthony Scaramucci from addressing its annual fundraising event after the short-lived White House communications director criticized President Trump’s “racially charged” tweets saying four members of Congress who are women of color should leave the United States.“He suggested the president’s comments were racist and that he was becoming a racist. Our board was infuriated,” said Michael A. Barnett, the Republican Party chairman in the county, home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago getaway.“We believe the tweets were not racist, the president is not racist and that Scaramucci’s comments were unfair,” Barnett, who is African American, said.“I am sorry that I was canceled,” he told POLITICO. “Mike Barnett must like and condone racist comments. Someone with more courage and less political expediency would call it for what it is and ask it to stop.”He actually stepped away from the microphone so they could chant more So why did he tweet “What a crowd, and what great people” after the rally?Booker makes it clear that his dispute with Biden isn’t overBooker was one of the first 2020 Democratic candidates to rebuke Biden’s comments [about segregationist colleagues], saying “he is wrong” to use the senators “as examples of how to bring our country together” and that Biden should apologize.Biden bristled at the comments, telling reporters, “Apologize for what? Cory should apologize.” He added, “He knows better. There’s not a racist bone in my body.”Biden later called Booker to smooth things over, but the tension was still evident on Thursday when Booker was asked at a Washington Post Live event whether he felt disrespected by Biden’s dismissal.“Of course I did,” Booker said. “How many times have we all in our lives, who are some kind of ‘other,’ dealt with mansplaining or dealt with condemning remarks?”Booker said the country needs a leader who is an “agent” of healing, reconciliation and truth-telling. He added that he was “stunned” it took Biden so long to apologize for championing the controversial 1994 crime bill, a measure fellow presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders also supported. Unsurprisingly, Trump has nothing but love for the “send her back” crowdEpstein doesn’t get to go back to his mansion, for nowNot unreasonably


Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThousands have marched in Puerto Rico for the fifth consecutive day, calling for the resignation of Governor Ricardo Rosselló. Protesters are demanding he resign after text messages between Mr Rosselló and his team were leaked on Saturday. The messages contained sexist and homophobic comments including references to singer Ricky Martin's sexuality. Mr Rosselló has refused to step down. Protesters say they have had enough of corruption on the island. They have also criticised the recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria in 2017. Two former top government officials from Mr Rosselló's administration were among a group arrested last week and charged with conspiracy and fraud involving millions of dollars in federal funding. Large crowds have gathered in San Juan for the past five days chanting "Ricky, resign!"On several days, police were seen firing tear gas at protesters in the capital. The text messages, obtained by Puerto Rico's Centre for Investigative Journalism, span some 900 pages. They were from a group chat that included the governor and 11 of his aides and cabinet members. The messages include jokes about Hurricane Maria victims along with sexist and homophobic comments. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when the hurricane hit the island in 2017. However a Harvard estimate puts the toll at more than 4,600. In one conversation, Christian Sobrino, then chief fiscal officer of Puerto Rico says he is "salivating to shoot" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz. Ms Cruz has criticised the governor in the past. Mr Rosselló replies: "You'd be doing me a grand favour."Another message from Mr Sobrino described singer Ricky Martin as a "male chauvinist" before referencing his sexuality. Mr Rosselló has apologised for the messages and said he respected the right to protest peacefully. He has also vowed to provide greater transparency and accountability to his government. Mr Sobrino and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin resigned following the leak. A statement from White House spokesman Judd Deere said that the events "prove the president's concerns about mismanagement, politicisation and corruption have been valid".Major figures have come out in support of the protesters. Ricky Martin led a protest to the governor's house on Wednesday. The singer said in a video on Twitter: "They mocked our dead, they mocked women, they mocked the LGBT community, they made fun of people with physical and mental disabilities, they made fun of obesity. It's enough. This cannot be."Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has shared images of the protests in Puerto Rico and attended a demonstration in New York. Reggaeton artist Bad Bunny has stopped his European tour to return to Puerto Rico and protest. He praised the "bravery" of people on the island. Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1898. Everyone born on the island is an American citizen and holds a US passport. However they cannot vote in the US presidential elections unless they are registered to vote in one of the 50 US states. Mr Rosselló promised to push for the island to become a state during his election campaign in 2016. It is still recovering from Hurricane Maria. Mr Rosselló has faced criticism for the handling of the recovery efforts. The island is also in the midst of a financial crisis and has billions of dollars in debt. Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world


Rep. Rick Larsen wants to impeach the president.Larsen, D-Everett, said President Donald Trump’s attacks, earlier this week, on four Democratic lawmakers, all of whom are women of color, make him unfit for office.“He will use any excuse to attack people, he’s using people’s citizenship to attack them, I just don’t know that he understands the value of U.S. citizenship and I don’t think he should be president,” Larsen said in a phone interview Thursday. “It has to do with his lack of understanding of U.S. citizenship and what that value means to people around the world.”Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, and Rep. Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, have previously come out in favor of starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump but have mostly stopped short of calling, flat out, for impeachment. Washington’s seven other Democratic members of Congress have not supported an impeachment inquiry.Larsen has been firmly opposed to opening an impeachment inquiry for conduct outlined in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, preferring to let the Democratic-controlled House of Representative’s various investigations run their course.He said his position on those investigations, which are ongoing, has not changed.But he said Trump’s attacks on Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, convinced him that Trump has “violated the public trust.”Trump, on Sunday, tweeted that the four congresswoman, three of whom were born in the United States and all of whom are American citizens, “originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe” and they should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces federal laws on job discrimination, writes on its website that, “Examples of potentially unlawful conduct include insults, taunting or ethnic epithets such as making fun of a person’s foreign accent or comments like ‘Go back to where you came from.'”Trump’s remarks sparked outrage among House Democrats, who voted unanimously on Tuesday, with the support of just four Republicans, to condemn Trump’s remarks as racist.On Wednesday, a motion to impeach Trump was defeated, with every Republican and most Democrats voting against impeachment. Larsen and Jayapal were the two Washington representatives who voted to impeach.Larsen said the resolution didn’t really “speak to the reasons I think we should pursue impeachment, but it was still an opportunity to send an early message about the evolution of my thinking.”He said he hasn’t asked other members of Congress their thoughts on impeachment and he hasn’t polled on the issue.“I don’t think any member of Congress should want to impeach the president,” Larsen said. “I felt like I was left with no choice because of the president’s disrespect of citizenship.”The opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only, and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.

A number of people gathered near the charred three-story studio of Kyoto Animation in the western Japanese city, where a day earlier a suspected arsonist shouted  "Die!" and that he had been plagiarized before dousing the building with what appeared to be petrol and setting it ablaze.     On Friday morning people gathered in the rain at the edge of the cordon set up by police and fire officials.      "It's hard to put into words how I feel," said 27-year-old Yuichi Kumami, a self-described animation fan, who had taken time off work at his company in nearby Osaka to lay flowers at the site.      "They may not be able to produce the same kind of works again and it was my hope that there would be more memorable works in the future, but that may be impossible now and that is very saddening," he said, his voice cracking with emotion.     A pillar of Japanese popular culture, animation has become a major cultural export, winning fans around the world. Kyoto Animation has an outsized role in the industry, with its influence outstripping the list of works it has produced.     Local resident Kazuko Yoshida, 78, said she lived close to the site and had smelt smoke on Thursday. From her second-floor window, she saw smoke and helicopters.       "I wonder why the company was targeted, why those people had to be caught up in this. It sounds like the man who did it wanted to die," she said.      "If he wanted to die he should have died alone, why did he have to involve other people? He is a terrible person."     One 23-year-old university student paid his respects before going to his lessons. He said he was a fan of  "anime", as Japanese animation is known.      "You hear about gun killings overseas, but anyone can get their hands on gasoline and that is pretty frightening," he said. "You can't stop people from buying gasoline, perhaps there's a way to offer help to people who might be tempted to commit crimes."     One local man, 82, passing by on his bicycle said he previously lived in the neighborhood.      "There was no fire escape on the outside of the building and I think that was a big reason why so many people died," he said.      "There was only one way for them to escape."

China and Russia have been forging new ties with Africa, a continent in which the United States has struggled to assert itself under President Donald Trump.Beijing has long prioritized its relationship with the continent, a frequent stop for Chinese diplomats and investors, and the People's Republic has increasingly sought to boost engagement in the defense sector as well. On Sunday, the first China-Africa Peace and Security Forum brought together nearly 100 senior representatives from the defense departments of 50 African countries and the African Union, including 15 defense ministers and chiefs of general staff, "to discuss new approaches of China-Africa security cooperation in the new era," according to the official website of the Chinese armed forces.In addition to hosting a number of projects associated with Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative involving billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and energy projects, Africa is also home to China's only overseas military base, in Djibouti, where the U.S. recently accused the Chinese military of "irresponsible actions" at the Pentagon's own base there.Washington has increasingly cautioned African countries against accepting Chinese influence, but the ongoing security forum showcased resilient relations between China and its partners thousands of miles away."In the face of new situations, the common languages, aspirations and interests of China and Africa in the peace and security field have been increasing," Major General Song Yanchao, deputy director of the Chinese Defense Ministry's Office for International Military Cooperation, was cited at saying on Wednesday. "Closer cooperation between the two sides means embracing new and precious historical opportunities."At an estimated 1.2 billion people, Africa's combined population is about 200 million less than that of China—but its $2 trillion GDP is just a sixth of that of the People's Republic, the world's second-largest economy. Of the 54 nations in Africa, some 39 have signed documents pledging cooperation with the Belt and Road Initiative, through which Xi has vowed to expand his country's economic footprint by paving new corridors through Asia, Africa, Europe and as far as Latin America.The plan has raised concerns within Africa and abroad that Beijing could trap developing countries in debt and use it as leverage against their internal affairs, something Chinese officials have repeatedly denied. Among the admirers of China's approach, however, was Russia, which itself has sought to project its growing influence in Africa.At a meeting Tuesday to discuss improving Moscow's investment in Africa, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told business leaders "there is probably a good reason to pay attention to the experience of China, which provides its enterprises with state guarantees and subsidies, thus ensuring the ability of companies to work on a systemic and long-term basis."The following day, Lavrov received Ivory Coast Foreign Minister Marcel Amon-Tanoh and told reporters that Russia wanted "to bring relations with Africa to a qualitatively different level." This included not only boosting investments, but making "a significant contribution" in the field of security—specifically in battling the threat of jihadi organizations such as the Islamic State militant group (ISIS), Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and Al-Shabab and combatting piracy off the coasts of West and East Africa.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, the presidential envoy for the Middle East and Africa, said Tuesday roughly 35 leaders have officially confirmed their participation in the upcoming Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi in October, according to the state-run Tass Russian News Agency.Bogdanov said he believed that "at least 40 leaders will come."While China and Russia boasted about their record trade figures with Africa, the tone was very different when U.S. officials recently paid a visit: At last month's U.S.-Africa Business Summit in Mozambique, Deputy Commerce Secretary Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley noted that exports into Africa have decreased by 32 percent since 2014."We know that American companies offer an unrivaled value proposition. Yet, we have lost ground to the increasingly-sophisticated, but too often opaque business practices of foreign competitors," Kelley said.The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized Beijing and Moscow's inroads into Africa, accusing them of shady dealings that would ultimately not benefit the interests of the continent, and certainly not those of Washington. In April, U.S. African Command chief Army General Stephen Townsend told the House Armed Services Committee that China and Russia were "offering a lot of military assistance and a lot of economic assistance but there's a whole lot of strings attached to that assistance."Still, other than Egypt, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has still not traveled to Africa. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, saw his tour there in March 2017 cut short when he was unceremoniously fired by Trump, who has never set foot on the continent.© 2019 Newsweek


SectionsSocialInformationsections(CNSNews.com) - Former Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will be "impeccably prepared" for his five hours in the spotlight next week, says one who knows him.Former Acting FBI Director Andy McCabe told CNN Thursday morning that he remembers past briefing sessions with Mueller, who was then the FBI Director:"I remember those sessions, they were kind of legendary. The hallway that led to his office on the seventh floor would be lined on both sides with briefing teams. They would just bring in one team after another on different issues. He would have been given massive three-ring binders of information all of which he had consumed and committed to memory before we came into the room.
	
	"And he was always prepared to kind of grill us and cross examine us on issues that we were talking about. So he is very studious. He's not a verbose and dramatic witness, but he knows his stuff."McCabe said he doubts Mueller will discuss anything beyond what's in his report. Mueller said that himself -- that he would not go beyond the four corners of the report -- when he briefly spoke to the public after the report came out.McCabe said one of the more frustrating things [for Democrats and anti-Trumpers] is that Mueller did not say whether Trump would have been charged with obstruction if he were a private citizen instead of the president."So if that's the place that Congress wants to get to, there are many, many ways they can get very close to that," McCabe said. "The report outlines at least ten different categories of obstructive activity. In eight of those 10 categories, director Mueller concluded there was significant evidence to support each of the three elements of the offense."Were I Congress, I would pick the top three or four areas that they think are most impactful and go through a very deliberate series of questions to get Director Mueller to talk about the evidence that supports each of those elements of the crime."Host John Berman asked McCabe what he thinks Mueller would say if he's asked, "Does DOJ typically seek to convict subjects of obstruction with evidence like this?""I think he'd have to say yes," McCabe replied. "He is a prosecutor by background. He brought cases, tried cases in federal court.
	
	“If you walk him through the evidence on one particular act of obstruction -- say, was there an obstructive act, and he describes one; you say, was there a nexus to a proceeding and he describes it; say, was there intent, and he describes the evidence; and then pose that question to him, it's going to be very hard for him to say that in similar circumstances a person confronting that sort of evidence wouldn't be charged with obstruction.”Berman asked McCabe, "Won't Democrats jump up and down for joy if they got Director Mueller to say yes, we wouldn't just charge but maybe convict someone?""I think it's an enormously significant point, I think it's one that the report comes very close to," McCabe said. "But it's also one the Democrats could elicit from the Director if he's questioned effectively, and that's a very big if."McCabe said if he were questioning Mueller, "I would pick out those three or four most offensive acts of obstruction with the most solid evidence and make sure that that's communicated in a clear and simple way to everyone watching."Copyright 1998-2019 CNSNews.com.The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.On Thursday, the president chided his supporters who chanted the statement at the rally, joining widespread criticism of the campaign crowd’s cry after fellow Republicans warned it could hurt the GOP in next year’s elections.In a week that has corkscrewed daily with hostile exchanges over race and love of country, Mr Trump also claimed he had tried to stop the chant at a reelection event Wednesday night in North Carolina.“I started speaking really quickly,” he told reporters. “I was not happy with it. I disagree with it.” However, video shows the crowd’s “send her back” shouts resounded for 13 seconds as Mr Trump made no attempt to interrupt them. He paused in his speech and surveyed the scene, taking in the uproar.Ms Omar responded on Thursday, telling reporters: “This is what this president and his supporters have turned our country” into, she said as she walked outside the US Capitol. “This is not about me," she added. "This is about fighting about what this country truly should be and what it deserves to be.”Additional reporting by AP. Please allow the live blog to load.Donald Trump has provoked a wave of condemnation after goading the crowd at a campaign rally into racist chanting about congresswoman Ilhan Omar.Supporters repeatedly chanted "send her back" after the US president launched his latest attack on the Democrat and three other congresswomen of colour at the event in Greenville, North Carolina, last night.Democrats  warned the president was “fuelling and feeding off hate” and “stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society” by vilifying Omar, a Somali refugee who arrived in the US as a child nearly three decades ago.Senator Bernie Sanders said Trump was “the most dangerous president in the history of our country,” while fellow 2020 election hopeful Elizabeth Warren called for him to face impeachment.Trump first tweeted on Sunday that Ms Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley should “go back“ to where they came from if they disagreed with his policies. All are US citizens and all except Ms Omar were born in the country.Trump intensified his attacks on the progressive representatives at last night's rally, depicting them as “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down”.“They never have anything good to say. That’s why I say: ‘Hey, if they don’t like it, let them leave. Let them leave,’” the president said.Trump paused speaking, looked around the room, and nodded as his supporters repeatedly chanted “send her back” at the mention of Omar’s name.Here's my colleague Adam Withnall's write-up of last night's Trump rally:The racist chant at last night's rally has prompted a chorus of condemnation from Democrat politicians. A number of the party's 2020 election candidates have spoken out on Twitter, voicing disgust at the scenes in North Carolina and expressing support for Ilhan Omar.Bernie Sanders said Trump was "stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in society" and described him as "the most dangerous president in the history of our country. Kamala Harris said Trump's conduct "defiles the office of president," while Elizabeth Warren called for him to face impeachment and Joe Biden expressed hope that Americans would reject Trump's racism.     The majority of Americans think Donald Trump’s recent tweets attacking four Democratic congresswomen are racist and un-American, a poll has found.Sixty-eight per cent of respondents to the USA Today/Ipsos poll said they found the president’s tweets “offensive”.Emma Snaith has the full story:The scenes at last night's Trump rally were reminiscent of the president’s 2016 election campaign events, at which his supporter’s chanted “lock her up” about his opponent Hillary Clinton.But Brian Schatz, Democrat senator for Hawaii, explains why he feels the chanting about Ilhan Omar was more troubling: Jon Favreau, Barack Obama's former speechwriter, say last night's rally was "one of the most chilling and horrifying things I’ve ever seen in politics": Amidst the widespread condemnation of the scenes at Trump's rally in North Carolina, some are also voicing fears that the president's recent racist rhetoric could escalate into something even worse.Here's a tweet from New York City mayor Bill de Blasio:Republicans in Washington largely seem to be remaining silent on Trump's Greenville rally, with almost all of the political condemnation coming from Democrats.However, there have been a handful of conservative commentators voicing dismay about the "send her back" chant.Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who has previously criticised Trump's racist tweets, called last night's scenes "ugly" and said "every Republican should condemn this bigotry immediately".He added the president was "a horrible human being" and said he feared "it will get worse".Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro said the chanting was "vile" and "disgusting", although he qualified his criticism by echoing Trump's claim that Ilhan Omar is a "radical antisemite".Fox News commentator Guy Benson also laid into Omar, but said he was "sicked by the hate-laced 'send her back' chants": Ilhan Omar is receiving support from around the world after Donald Trump's latest racist attack prompted his supporters to erupt in chants calling for her deportation.The hashtag #IStandWithIlhan is the currently the top trending topic in the US as thousands of people post messages of solidarity. Politicians in the UK have also voiced support for the congresswoman. London mayor Sadiq Khan - himself a frequent target for Mr Trump's invective - said the four congresswomen targeted by Trump "represent hope for the future".Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said the "racist rally sends shivers down my spine", while her party colleague Jess Phillips said: "This is what fascism looks like. We must fight it at home and abroad."Ed Davey, a contender in the Liberal Democrat leadership contest, tweeted of last night's chant: "This is heartbreaking and terrifying. If we don't learn from history we are doomed to repeat it."All of us who stand for liberal values, and for decency, must stand up to Trump's disgusting racism and the hate he sows."Theresa May's official spokesman said: "I don't know if the prime minister has seen it but as I said earlier in the week the president's comments in respect of the congresswomen were completely unacceptable and that remains the case."After being questioned about the president’s racist tweets, in which Trump told four congresswomen to “go back" to the “crime infested places from which they came," representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania told Vice News: “You know, they talk about people of colour. I'm a person of colour. I'm white. I'm an Anglo Saxon. People say things all the time, but I don't get offended.” Here's the full, strange story: Donald Trump met with Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad, a Yazidi genocide survivor, at the White House yesterday. But he seemed unfamiliar with her work, and Yazidi persecution in general, reports my colleague Richard Hall:In the UK, prime ministerial candidate Jeremy Hunt has refused to say the word "racism" during an interview about Donald Trump's attacks on four congresswomen of colour.Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast, he said he "absolutely, profoundly" disagreed with Trump's comments. But he added: "I'm not going to user the R-word because I do have to be responsible for the relationship between the UK and the USA and I think it would be damaging for that if I used it". Donald Trump's racist attacks on four Democratic congresswomen may have led to a wave of condemnation, but Republican strategists believe they could also lead to his re-election.Terry Sullivan, a frequent Trump critic who managed senator Marco Rubio's 2016 election campaign, said the president was successfully getting to make "these extremely liberal, socialist, foolish congresswomen the face of the Democratic Party"."What he's doing here is sad, but it's smart politics," he said.Sylvester Smith, a conservative political consultant, told Sky News the president was "trying to rally his base and he's trying to do what he's always done, which is grab headlines and which he's been very successful at".He added: "If you look at this tactic from the vantage of Trump the presidential candidate, I believe that long term it's going to be a viable tactic for a successful re-election for him."The Democratic congresswomen who have been the target of Donald Trump's attacks this week were all elected in this year's midterm elections. Here's a look at the four women of colour who collectively call themselves "the Squad": The most search words on Merriam-Webster's online dictionary during and after Donald Trump's rally last night tell a fairly bleak story: The chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee has said there is "no place" for the kind of chants heard at Donald Trump's rally last night.But Minnesota representative Tom Emmer defended Trump himself, telling reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast "there's not a racist bone in this president's body".He claimed the president repeatedly telling four Democratic women of colour to "go back" to the "totally broken and crime infested places from which they came" had nothing to do with race or even nationality.Trump simply meant dissatisfied people could leave the US if they want, he suggested."That goes for every one of us. It has nothing to do with your race, your gender or your family history," Emmer insisted.There have been a few more muted Republican murmurings of disapproval over last night's "send her back" chants.House GOP vice-chair Mark Walker, a North Carolina representative, said he "struggled" with the chant.He slightly feebly suggests the "phrasing" was "painful to our friends in the minority communities".Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger is more vehement in his condemnation of the chant, which he says is "ugly, wrong, and would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers".Please allow a moment for this live article to loadOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran on Friday denied President Donald Trump’s statement that a U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone near the Persian Gulf after it threatened the ship — an incident that marked a new escalation of tensions between the countries less than a month after Iran downed an American drone in the same waterway and Trump came close to retaliating with a military strike.“We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else,” tweeted Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.The strait is at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and serves as the passageway for a fifth of all global crude exports; a clash there highlights the risk of war between Iran and the U.S.Trump on Thursday said the USS Boxer took defensive action after an Iranian drone closed to within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.Trump blamed Iran for a “provocative and hostile” action and said the U.S. responded in self-defense. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told reporters as he arrived for a meeting at the United Nations that “we have no information about losing a drone today.”After Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal last year and imposed economic sanctions on Tehran, the Iranians have pushed back on the military front, shooting down a U.S. drone on June 20.Also in the past weeks, the Persian Gulf region has seen six attacks on oil tankers that the U.S. has blamed on Iran, and a tense encounter between Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and the British navy. Iran has denied involvement in the attacks or the British naval encounter.The U.S. has also sent thousands of additional troops and increased its security presence in the region.Adding to the economic pressure on Tehran, the Treasury Department said Thursday it was imposing sanctions on what it called a network of front companies and agents involved in helping Iran buy sensitive materials for its nuclear program. It said the targeted individuals and entities are based in Iran, China and Belgium.The Pentagon said Thursday’s incident happened at 10 a.m. local time in international waters while the Boxer was transiting the waterway to enter the Persian Gulf. The Boxer is among several U.S. Navy ships in the area, including the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier that has been operating in the nearby North Arabian Sea for weeks.Neither Trump nor the Pentagon spelled out how the Boxer destroyed the drone. CNN reported that the ship used electronic jamming to bring it down rather than hitting it with a missile.The Iranians and Americans have had close encounters in the Strait of Hormuz in the past, and it’s not unprecedented for Iran to fly a drone near a U.S. warship.In December, about 30 Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessels trailed the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier and its strike group through the strait as Associated Press journalists on board watched. One small vessel launched what appeared to be a commercial-grade drone to film the U.S. ships.Other transits have seen the Iranians fire rockets away from American warships or test-fire their machine guns. The Guard’s small fast boats often cut in front of the massive carriers, running dangerously close to running into them in “swarm attacks.” The Guard boats are often armed with bomb-carrying drones and sea-to-sea and surface-to-sea missiles.Thursday’s incident was the latest in a series of events that raised U.S.-Iran tensions since early May when Washington accused Tehran of threatening U.S. forces and interests in Iraq and in the Gulf.In response, the U.S. accelerated the deployment of the Lincoln and its strike group to the Arabian Sea and deployed four B-52 long-range bombers to the Gulf state of Qatar. It has since deployed additional Patriot air defense missile batteries in the Gulf region.Shortly after Iran shot down a U.S. Navy drone aircraft in June, Trump ordered a retaliatory military strike but called it off at the last moment, saying the risk of casualties was disproportionate to the downing by Iran, which did not cost any U.S. lives.Iran claimed the U.S. drone violated its airspace; the Pentagon denied this.Zarif said Thursday that Iran and the U.S. were only “a few minutes away from a war” after Iran downed the American drone. He spoke to U.S.-based media on the sidelines of his visit to the U.N.“We live in a very dangerous environment,” he said. “The United States has pushed itself and the rest of the world into probably the brink of an abyss.”Zarif blamed Washington for the escalation and accused the Trump administration of “trying to starve our people” and “deplete our treasury” through economic sanctions.Earlier Thursday, Iran said the Revolutionary Guard seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for smuggling fuel out of the country, and hours later released video showing the vessel to be a United Arab Emirates-based ship that had vanished in Iranian waters over the weekend.The announcement cleared up the fate of the missing ship but raised a host of other questions and heightened worries about the free flow of traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s most critical petroleum shipping routes. One-fifth of global crude exports pass through the strait.___Superville and Burns reported from Washington.

The president has refused to sever ties with his hotels, golf courses and condos – raising conflict of interest and corruption concerns
Peter Stone in Washington

Fri 19 Jul 2019 00.00 EDT


Last modified on Fri 19 Jul 2019 00.06 EDT

From Florida to New York to Scotland and many other places, Donald Trump’s business empire has attracted a growing clientele of lobbyists, foreign governments, big donors and other Trump allies looking to curry favor, and helping generate hundreds of millions of dollars for his golf course resorts, condos and hotels.While much attention has focused on Trump’s Washington DC hotel as a honeypot for those seeking to influence the administration, Trump’s broader property empire across the US – and overseas – also concerns critics who say the president is using his office for financial benefit.During his first two full years as president, Trump’s revenues from his far-flung real estate business, which his two eldest sons are running while he is president, totaled at least $886m, according to Trump’s annual financial disclosures.Trump’s controversial decision not to completely sever ties to his real estate interests in the US and overseas, or put his assets in a blind trust to limit conflicts of interest, has sparked strong condemnation from ethics watchdog groups, political analysts and congressional Democrats.The financial web of ties between the president and his various properties is underscored by all manner of fundraising bashes, lobbyist meetings and foreign stays at Trump’s properties, spawning legal and ethics complaints.“Whether accepting money from political candidates, lobbyists or foreign governments, the president’s businesses seem all too willing to promote the message that the presidency is for sale,” Congressman Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the House oversight and reform committee, said in a statement.According to his annual financial disclosures, Trump’s top revenue-producing properties have done handsomely by hosting fundraisers, lobbyist meetings and foreign delegations. They include:• The Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami, a favorite hangout for lobbyists and donors with ties to Trump, is a leading revenue source, yielding close to $151m in his first two years as president. Notably, the Doral club hosted annual meetings in 2018 and 2019 for a business group of payday lenders whose exorbitant interest rates sparked a regulatory crackdown by the Obama administration, but have been cheered by recent Trump administration rollbacks.• Trump’s self styled “summer White House” in Bedminster, New Jersey, had revenues of $30.8m in the same two-year period. On 19 July, Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee are slated to host a big fundraiser in Bedminster where donors who pony up $100,000 can get their picture taken with Trump, enjoy a roundtable chat with him and other perks.• Mar-a-Lago, the swanky Palm Beach club where Trump doubled the annual membership fee to $200,000 when he became president, pulled in revenues totaling $48m in the two-year period. As ProPublica first revealed, a trio of wealthy Mar-a-Lago members, who are friends of Trump, played a big role in shaping policy at the Department of Veterans Affairs, spurring a House panel to look into allegations of “improper influence”.• Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, which Trump has visited and promoted in tweets while in office as “incredible”, notched revenues of $43.8m in 2017 and 2018.Robert Maguire, the research director of the nonpartisan ethics watchdog Crew, said the web of influence peddling at Trump’s properties poses “…unprecedented conflicts of interest. President Trump’s continued financial ties to his businesses including his hotel have been received by his administration and political allies not with scorn, but enthusiastic support.”Little wonder Trump’s financial ties to his businesses have prompted congressional scrutiny by the House oversight committee and other panels, plus a lawsuit by more than 200 Democrats alleging the foreign business at his properties violate an anti-corruption clause in the constitution designed to curb improper foreign influence on federal officials.Data compiled by Crew sheds further light on the web of ties between the president and his businesses.Recent Crew data found that through mid-2019, Trump has made at least 345 visits to properties that he continues to profit from while in office. Further, Trump personally mentioned or referred to his company at least 143 times since taking office, the Crew data also showed.Some powerful lobbyists, such as Florida’s Brian Ballard, who is known to have good ties to Trump, have also helped boost business at Trump properties via his clients. One example: Geo Group, a private prison company that Ballard lobbies for, won a $110m contract in 2017 to build an immigration detention facility in Texas and soon after moved its annual leadership meeting to Trump’s Doral golf club.Other Ballard clients, including Nigerian officials, have hosted meetings or stayed at the Trump hotel in DC.Foreign government patronage of Trump properties has been especially notable, sparking separate lawsuits by some 200 Democrats in Congress, as well as attorneys general from Maryland and DC, who allege that they violate the foreign emoluments clause in the constitution. The clause bars foreign payments or gifts to federal officials without authorization by Congress.The justice department has fought the suits, arguing the clause should only apply to direct payments to the president and not foreign patronage of his properties, a position very similar to one expressed in early 2017 by Trump’s own lawyers.NBC News recently calculated that representatives of at least 22 foreign governments – including some facing charges of corruption or human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and the Philippines – seem to have spent funds at Trump properties while he has been president.Foreign spending at Trump properties mainly includes meetings, overnight stays and rentals or purchases.Trump pledged to donate foreign profits from his properties to the government while he is in office, and the Trump Organization has written checks totaling $343,000 to the treasury for 2017 and 2018. But critics have said it’s impossible to verify if these checks fully cover foreign payments to Trump properties in part because Trump – unlike other presidents – has refused to release his tax returns.Cummings, who leads one of a few House panels that have issued subpoenas or gone to court to obtain financial information on Trump’s income sources and businesses, says more sunlight on Trump’s foreign and domestic revenues is badly needed.“The American people deserve complete transparency over these payments and the identities of those attempting to curry favor with the administration,” Cummings said.


When 65,853,514 of us cast our ballots 
for Hillary Clinton on November 8, 2016, we were voting for the relative peace, opportunity and pluralism of Barack Obama’s America. The majority of voters that day at the polls hoped for an experienced leader known for effectiveness and compromise.We got the opposite. Now 2016 is a distant country, and high-minded Obaman governance — with its emphasis on civility and common ground — seems more like complicity than collegiality.Our country’s problems have become too dark, too deep and too pervasive for Democrats to think it’s enough to ease President Trump out in a fair — hah — 2020 election. It won’t work to restore power to an establishment politician who
 will glad-hand with Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and try to hide the structural damage Trump has done to democracy.What the nation should welcome is every effort to shake congressional leadership out of its dogmatic coma. The motion on Tuesday by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) to impeach Trump for his racist remarks was promptly tabled as impolite, premature or somehow unwise. It should have been greeted as a shot in the arm for lawmakers who meet the daily catastrophe in the White House mostly with
 lethargy, defeatism and stupefaction. What is required is anything but for good people to keep doing nothing.So let this be a shout out to noisy “extremists,” to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the squad,” to former Republican Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), to California Sen. Kamala Harris. Moderate
 Democrats are standing on ceremony in a way that seems increasingly bizarre. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shouldn’t allow 
impeachment hearings because it might fire up the redhats who shout “send her back” about Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar
? The Justice Department can’t indict a sitting president despite his clear criminal conduct? We should shush
 politicians of color who talk about desegregation and, for heaven’s sake, civil rights because they might alienate racists? These dictates are excuses for a form of nervous gradualism that, as the months of Trump’s border camps and white supremacy grind on, has become paralysis.According to Dr. Bandy Lee, a Yale psychiatrist whose team has produced a report — “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump” — the nation is suffering a kind of cognitive stagnation, a moral contraction, a death wish. There are even indices that suggest a literal death wish. Life expectancy in the U.S., on the rise since the dawn of the republic, is now in decline. Despair diseases — depression, addiction, suicide — are highest in counties that went for Trump.This is no time to lie
 down and die. Yet congressional leaders of all stripes seem to be succumbing to their own despair disease. In Federalist 51, which explains the role checks and balances play in the Constitution, James Madison wrote, “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” In other words, Madison believed that a nation — even a nation of devils — required contention to keep itself in working order.Those who panic about infighting among Democrats in Congress, or among the 2020 presidential candidates, are only stifling productive Madisonian conflict. Those who carp about upstarts are only adding to the atrophy of the body politic.Last week on “The View,” candidate Harris was asked why she had “attacked” former Vice President Joe Biden on his civil rights record. “This is a presidential race, “ she said. “We’re on a debate stage. And if you haven’t prepared, and you are not ready … then 
 you are probably not ready.” That’s right, and you won’t succeed in taking the White House back from Trump.The president cannot abide so much as a goofy sketch sending up his norm-breaking on “Saturday Night Live.” He is intent on gagging, intimidating, even jailing his opponents (e.g. Clinton, James B. Comey, Omar, even Robert S. Mueller III). He is supremely willing to obstruct justice, according to hundreds of former federal prosecutors who’ve done what too few of us have:
 read the Mueller report. His blocks and tackles are an admission that his ideas, policies and his presidency cannot withstand the contest of ambitions 
Madison identified as the lifeblood of the republic.But Pelosi can take being called an out-of-step careerist. Ocasio-Cortez can take being called an attention-seeking socialist. Biden can, one hopes, brook a challenge to his past positions. They — and the country — will be better for it. That kind of engagement among Democrats is the only way to keep an imperiled nation alive.Twitter: @page88Sign up for our newslettersSubscribe for unlimited access

"She was very exhausted and had a nice day-long nap," he told the BBC. The house owner, Motilal, who also owns the adjoining shop, fled the house along with his family members as soon as they saw the tiger walking in. "The great thing was that nobody disturbed her so she could rest. There's a lot of respect for wildlife in this region," Mr Barman said. "[Motilal] says he will preserve the bed sheet and pillow on which the tiger rested."WTI officials were later called to the scene and began preparing a safe escape route for her. They blocked traffic on the highway for an hour and set off firecrackers to wake the animal up. She eventually left the house at 17:30 local time, crossed the highway and went in the direction of the forest.Mr Barman said it was not clear if she had actually entered the forest or if she had just "walked off into an adjoining area".The Unesco-recognised Kaziranga National Park is home to 110 tigers, but none of them have died.Animals killed in the park include 54 hog deer, seven rhinos, six wild boars and one elephant. Monsoon floods have devastated the eastern states of Bihar and Assam, killing more than 100 people and displacing millions. The monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, has also wreaked havoc in Nepal and Bangladesh as well.

Latest data shows carmakers will offer 214 electric car models in 2021, up from 60 models at the end of 2018. More affordable options could see consumers switch from petrol and diesel cars sooner than anticipated.Analysis by the European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&E), based on data by research firm IHS Markit, suggests that car manufacturers are now ready to embrace car electrification.In 2021, carmakers are forecast to bring 92 fully electric models and 118 plug-in hybrid models to market.If they stick to these plans, 22% of vehicles produced could have a plug by 2025, which would enable manufacturers to easily meet the EU's car CO2 emissions target of 95g/km by 2025.The biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, the data shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. "Thanks to the EU car CO2 standards, Europe is about to see a wave of new, longer range, and more affordable electric cars hit the market," said Lucien Mathieu, a transport and e-mobility analyst at T&E."That is good news, but the job is not yet done. We need governments to help roll out electric vehicle charging at home and at work, and we need changes to car taxation to make electric cars even more attractive than polluting diesel, petrol or poor plug-in hybrid vehicles."Even luxury sports carmakers are jumping on to the electric bandwagon. This week, Lotus, owned by Chinese firm Geely, unveiled a £2m all-electric "hypercar" - the Evija - capable of more than 200mph (322km/h). And in March, Automobili Pininfarina launched a similarly-priced electric hypercar - the Battista. The message from these manufacturers is that electric can be glamorous and exciting, not just environmentally necessary, says our technology of business editor, Matthew Wall.Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world

More info: Privacy PolicyThe statement comes after US President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed an American ship had destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz that ignored its warnings. At the same time, Tehran has stated that the Iranian military has no information about losing an aircraft."We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] by mistake!", Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Twitter, referring to the recent incident.In the meantime, the Iranian military has announced that all of its unmanned aircraft safely returned to base, Tasnim News agency reported.The claims about the Iranian drone come amid another escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran.This is the #US electronic warfare weapon used in an alleged takedown of #Iran #drone, report says https://t.co/kfT6JkBp9R pic.twitter.com/e9h20h5YmBSeveral oil tankers have reportedly been attacked in the Middle East, so the US and allies rushed to accuse the Islamic Republic of organising those incidents.Later, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps downed an American unmanned aircraft, saying it had violated Iranian airspace. The United States was reportedly ready to undertake a retaliatory operation against Iran, but President Trump said he had cancelled it ten minutes before the start.Sputnik push notificationsWe are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.Please review our Privacy Policy.

America has pursued the same foreign policy for almost two decades, and the results aren’t good. In Afghanistan, for example, the Taliban controls the same area of land it held a decade ago. By most metrics, things are getting worse, and there is no end in sight. But instead of admitting its failure and changing course, Washington’s foreign policy establishment insists there is no option but the status quo—and then demands its critics do the impossible: predict the future.The latest example of this occurred when Kevin Baron, executive editor of The Atlantic’s Defense One, penned an op-ed titled “‘End forever wars’ is a soundbite, not a security policy.”Baron criticizes those who point out how long we’ve been in Afghanistan, and who point out the lack of progress on the ground. He says that, instead, we should ask ourselves whether Afghanistan is making America safer. Baron then lists the countries and regions where America is now intervening, asking critics of these permanent wars to prove terror won’t thrive once we leave. Absent that impossible accomplishment, he—like the rest of Washington’s foreign policy “blob”—won’t countenance U.S. departure.Some policymakers and pundits no doubt have vague foreign policy plans. And after three successive presidents campaigned on less interventionist foreign policies only to (so far) under-deliver while in office, there should be much doubt from anyone promising to radically change course if they were to win in 2020. But the foreign policy establishment is wrong to think ending forever wars isn’t a security policy. It is exactly that.In demanding more specifics, Baron unintentionally makes the case for abandoning the foreign policy status quo. The many countries in which the U.S. military is intervening—Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and dozens of troubled countries in Africa—are all incredibly complex. It is admittedly not possible to know exactly what would happen after an American exit, especially in the long term. But by that very token, this complexity is why Washington cannot bend these troubled regions to its will.What’s more, these forever wars are not strategically important to America’s security. Baron points out that Al-Qaeda operated from Afghanistan to hit America on 9/11. But we have plenty of options that don’t entail occupation and nation building to keep Al-Qaeda from again having a safe-haven. And Al-Qaeda is already operating in other areas alongside supposed U.S. partners—including Saudi Arabia, which has had ties with Al-Qaeda in Syria and Yemen’s civil wars. Often, the turmoil created because of our interventions opens a space for Al-Qaeda or Islamic State to operate in—Libya, Syria, and Iraq provide perfect examples.And because of the complexity of the Middle East—and the limits of our military, which is intended to destroy, not build—there is a very real risk that American intervention and nation building is making things worse, not better. Washington may be unwittingly stunting the growth of a moderate Islamic movement, which is the only real long-term solution to Islamic extremism. Meanwhile, intervention too often aligns the U.S. with bad actors. In Syria, American special forces were ordered to train fighters suspected of being jihadists. The program was completely ineffectual for advancing U.S. interests, but cost American taxpayers $1 billion per year. That’s not the only questionable partnership that reckless interventionism has produced: When the Sunni Islamic State emerged, America found itself coordinating with Shia Iran. In Afghanistan, there is a widespread practice of “bacha bazi,” the sexual abuse of young boys, by certain Afghan warlords, police, and military—who are often protected, supported, and funded by our government. American soldiers are horrified by the practice, but have been told by their superiors to ignore the abuse—after all, the warlords are “allies” against the Taliban.This problem was exposed in 2015, when several of the abused young boys obtained guns and started shooting their abusers as well as American servicemembers. It is indefensible for Washington to put our soldiers in this position. The problem is still ongoing today, as evidenced by a 2018 report released by the Trump administration that the Obama administration had sought to hide until 2042—though there is little indication the situation has changed under the Trump administration. That Washington continues to put our soldiers in these situations is immoral. We don’t have to choose between arming potential jihadists and Bashar al-Assad. We don’t have to take a side in the centuries-long Sunni-Shia rivalry. We don’t have to choose between warlords who keep child sex slaves and the Taliban (who criminalized the practice). There is a third choice: drastically recalibrate U.S.-Middle East policy and reduce our ground presence.The risk of oversimplifying is real. But that is no argument for prolonging forever war. Instead of trying to make sense out of chaos, instead of futile attempts to bend a complex system to our will, the best policy is to force the region to sort out its own problems, while U.S. military power focuses on keeping Americans safe. At this point, the burden of proof falls on the Washington establishment to show why the status quo is working. That too is an impossible task.Willis L. Krumholz is a fellow at Defense Priorities.

  Street art in Puerto Rico has long channeled widespread frustrations about the island’s century-long status as a U.S. territory. The work of La Puerta is one such example. The anonymous collective voicing ideas of identity and politics exploded throughout San Juan over the last year, but now, their protest art might come at a cost.In May, the country’s penal code was amended to punish acts like disrupting school activity and painting on public walls with jail time. Human rights lawyer Ariadna Godreau-Aubert worries, “These new amendments are trying to implicate street art as well as every other kind of free speech activity against austerity and the government.”La Puerta’s street murals often advocate for the island’s independence, a political debate revived by the fiscal crisis. On June 11, a referendum took place where Puerto Ricans voted between statehood, free association/independence, and the status quo.Leading up to the vote, VICE News followed the La Puerta collective as they took to an expressway that’s become the go-to spot for their political messages.Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo

                                        Let’s suppose that a teacher stood up in front of her class and said students should go back to the corrupt countries from which they came. What would happen?We all know the answer. She would be fired, and justly so. The comment is racist to its core, and it has no place in a school classroom.That’s why all of our schools — and all of our teachers — should denounce President Donald Trump’s recent comments about four Democratic congresswomen. Schools are required to teach the skills and habits of democratic life: civility, tolerance and mutual respect. When the president breaches those norms, we have to call him out.At the same time, however, we also need to guard against vilifying students who support Trump. Our message must be clear and unequivocal: They can like the president. They just can’t act like him, insofar as he violates the principles that undergird democracy itself.That’s what Trump did, in a series of comments about Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. On Sunday,he tweeted that the four lawmakers should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” He doubled down on the slur the following day, using his all-caps button to tweet, “IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE, YOU CAN LEAVE.” Then he tripled down Wednesday at his North Carolina rally, which erupted in chants of "send her back" when he attacked Omar.Listen to women of color: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a women of color problemNever mind that Omar is the only one of the four who actually came to America from another country, or that white supremacists welcomed Trump’s remarks. “It doesn’t concern me, because many people agree with me,” the president said, when asked about racist support for him.This is precisely why our schools need to teach a different lesson. Reasonable and decent people can disagree about Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and everything else. Yet no reasonable or decent person would tell another American to leave the country simply because of that person's opinions or racial background.President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on July 16, 2019. (Photo: Alex Brandon/AP)That’s why the school board in Fort Worth, Texas, recently fired a teacher who posted on social media that her district was “loaded with illegal students” and that Trump should help remove them. When a student asked to go to the bathroom, she also allegedly said, “Show me your papers that are saying you are legal.”And it’s also why a substitute teacher in Los Angeles was dismissed for telling her students — on the day after Trump was elected — that their parents would be deported. “If you were born here, then your parents gotta go and they gonna leave you behind,” she reportedly said. “You’ll be in foster care."These teachers are free to believe whatever they want about Trump, immigration and everything else. But they should not be allowed to slur immigrants — or anybody else — in the racist manner that Trump does.Simultaneously, though, we also must take pains not to slur all Trump supporters as racist. Surely some of them are, as white-supremacist praise of Trump's tweets confirmed. But denouncing every Trump voter as a bigot echoes the same intolerance that Trump himself has injected into our public discourse.Witness the Virginia teacher’s assistant who allegedly called a student wearing a Trump 2020 flag “racist and sexist.” She also reportedly tried to shove the flag — which bore Trump’s signature slogan, “Make America Great Again” — down the student’s shirt.'Go home': Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.Or consider the Georgia teacher who was placed on leave — and later resigned — after she asked two students to turn their MAGA T-shirts inside out. She also told her students that wearing Trump’s slogan was like displaying a Nazi swastika.Leave aside the fact that28% of Hispanics casting ballots in 2016 voted for Trump, who polled better than Mitt Romney did with that group in 2012.Teachers have no business denouncing an entire category of voters, any more than they should slur people on the basis of their race or immigrant status.But nor should our teachers shirk from identifying blatantly racist statements when the president of the United States makes them. So far, most GOP politicians have kept quiet in the face of Trump’s bigoted barrage. Our teachers can’t — and shouldn’t — do that. Their job is to prepare future citizens for democracy, which requires us to treat each other with dignity and respect.Trump’s recent comments about the four congresswomen fly in the face of that. So do his claims that Mexicans are rapists, and that African countries are s---holes. No decent human being talks that way. No decent parent would let their children talk that way.And if they do, our schools need to teach a better way. There are no two sides here, and every reasonable person knows that. No matter what we believe about President Trump, we must make sure our children do not behave like him. The entire fate of our democracy rests on that distinction. Shame on us if we lose sight of it.      Jonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania.

The reality TV star Kim Kardashian West thanked President Donald Trump and senior members of his administration on Thursday in the wake of reports they had stepped in try to get the rapper A$AP Rocky released from a Swedish jail.In a Twitter post Thursday afternoon, Kardashian West linked to a TMZ report that said "President Trump is very much aware of A$AP Rocky's legal sitch in Sweden — and he's got his team working to get him freed ... thanks in part to Kim K and Kanye West."She thanked Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, and "everyone involved" with what she called "the efforts to Free ASAP Rocky."Thank you @realDonaldTrump , @SecPompeo, Jared Kushner & everyone involved with the efforts to Free ASAP Rocky & his two friends. Your commitment to justice reform is so appreciated ???????? https://t.co/Ym1Rzo5Z6cKardashian West and many other prominent figures have publicly called on Sweden to free Rocky, who was detained early this month in connection with a street fight in Stockholm late last month.NBC News has not confirmed the TMZ report. Kardashian West did not comment on the part of the report that said she and her husband, Kanye West, personally lobbied the administration on Rocky's behalf.Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, and three other people were detained on "probable grounds for serious assault" in Stockholm on July 3, a day after he headlined the Smash x Stadion hip-hop festival.A court ruled that Rocky was a flight risk after he and members of his entourage were alleged to have been involved in a brawl on June 30 in which authorities said a person was beaten and cut with broken bottles.In videos posted to Rocky's Instagram account, he and members of his entourage are seen arguing with two men on the street, telling the men to stop following them. In one of the clips, Rocky can be heard telling one of the men: "Listen, we don't want to fight y'all. We not trying to go to jail."Prosecutors have until Friday morning to decide whether Rocky will be formally charged.In May 2018, Kardashian West met with the president at the White House to discuss prison reform and a possible pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, who was more than two decades into a life sentence for a first-time conviction in a drug-trafficking case.Trump commuted Johnson's sentence a month later.© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

One child was stabbed 38 times.Ms Quinn was murdered the following day after arriving at the house as usual to see the children.The court heard Harvey had planned for weeks to kill his family, including writing in a journal about "eliminating" them.He remained with the bodies for five days, before driving about 1,430km (900 miles) north to the town of Pannawonica, where his parents live.After hearing his son confess to the crimes, Harvey's father phoned police. Harvey was in custody a short time later.Harvey's lawyers had argued that he deserved a sentence with the possibility of parole due to his young age and prospects for rehabilitation.A psychologist's report shown to the court said that Harvey had fantasised about becoming a serial killer, reported news outlet WA Today.It also said Harvey had spoken about his anxiety and depression, but that it was difficult to say whether he had autism or narcissistic personality disorder.Justice Hall said Harvey's claims of remorse were inconsistent with other evidence, arguing the killer had gone beyond "a mere record of dark fantasies" to actively planning the murders.The judge said the crimes were so horrific that Harvey should never be eligible for parole, a sentenced that has been permitted - but not previously applied - since 2008.Ms Harvey's sister, Taryn Tottman, described the sentence as "extremely suitable", but added that "we ourselves have been given a life sentence"."In an ideal world, now that sentencing has been handed down, my family would return," she said outside court."But I know that this will never happen."Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world


4 Min ReadUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock called out Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for only paying a “modest proportion” of the hundreds of millions of dollars they pledged five months ago to a humanitarian appeal for Yemen. Both countries each promised $750 million at a U.N. fundraising event in February that was seeking $4 billion, but Saudi Arabia so far has paid only $121.7 million and the United Arab Emirates about $195 million, according to U.N. figures. Saudi Arabia leads a Western-backed military coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 in a bid to restore the government ousted from power by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. The United Arab Emirates is a key member of the coalition.  “Those who made the largest pledges – Yemen’s neighbors in the coalition – have so far paid only a modest proportion of what they promised,” Lowcock told the U.N. Security Council, adding that as a result the U.N. appeal was only 34 percent funded compared with 60 percent at this time last year.  Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi said Saudi Arabia had paid more than $400 million to the United Nations and other aid organizations this year.  “This year we alone ... we have paid more money into Yemen than any of the donors in the world,” Al-Mouallimi told reporters.  The UAE mission to the United Nations said the country is “currently working with the UN on the modalities of the 2019 commitment to ensure maximum benefits for the Yemeni people,” and said that since April 2015 it had given $5.5 billion in aid to Yemen. The United Nations describes the situation in Yemen - where the four-year-long war has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions on the brink of famine - as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The United States has paid more than $288.7 million to the U.N. Yemen appeal, making it the largest donor for 2019. Washington sells billions of dollars worth of weapons and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.  “We join the call today for all donors to step up assistance in Yemen, and to fulfill their financial commitments,” senior U.S. diplomat Rodney Hunter told the Security Council.  The World Food Programme (WFP) said on June 20 it had started a partial suspension of aid in Yemen, citing failure to reach a deal with the Houthis on controls to prevent the diversion of food away from vulnerable people. The decision affects 850,000 people in the capital Sanaa. “We have been negotiating all night long and as of this moment we have an agreement in principle, but it’s not in a signed agreement as of yet,” David Beasley, executive director of the WFG, told the Security Council.  He said once an agreement was signed, the WFP could have food on the streets in Sanaa within days.  U.N.-led mediation efforts in Yemen have been focused on implementing a deal agreed by the parties in Sweden in December on a ceasefire and troop pullback in Yemen’s Hodeidah region.  “My hope is that progress in Hodeidah will finally allow us to focus on the political process, and I hope that we will see this before the end of this summer,” U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council.      Reporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Susan Thomas and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

6 Min ReadTOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono summoned and admonished South Korea’s ambassador on Friday in a deepening diplomatic dispute over compensation for Korean wartime forced labor that threatens global supply of memory chips and display screens. The dispute took a tragic turn earlier on Friday when a South Korean man set himself on fire in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul in an apparent protest and later died from his injuries. South Korea’s ambassador to Japan, Nam Gwan-pyo, was summoned to meet Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono a day after a midnight deadline set by Japan for South Korea to accept third-country arbitration of the forced labor dispute passed. South Korea has rejected third-country arbitration and Kono said Seoul must take swift measures to correct what Japan says was an improper ruling last year by South Korea’s Supreme Court ordering two Japanese firms to compensate the wartime workers. Japan says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty which established diplomatic relations between the two nations post World War Two. “What the South Korean government is doing now is equivalent to subverting the post-World War Two international order,” Kono said at the start of the meeting.  Nam responded that South Korea was working every day to create an environment where the lawsuits could be dealt with in a way that would be acceptable to both sides and not harm bilateral ties.  The two diplomats exchanged testy remarks in front of reporters, with Kono interrupting when Nam said South Korea had already proposed a plan to resolve the issue. “Hold on,” Kono said. “We’ve already told the South Korean side the South Korean proposal was totally unacceptable, and that is not something that would redress the situation where international law is violated. It is extremely impertinent to propose it again by pretending to not know that.” Neither official specified what that plan was, but last month Japan rejected a South Korean proposal to form a joint fund with Japan to compensate South Korean plaintiffs. Later, South Korea’s foreign ministry rejected Japan’s call for third-party arbitration as arbitrary and said Japan must instead remember the wrongs it committed during colonial rule and make efforts to heal the wound.  South Korea’s Trade Ministry on Friday repeated calls for Japan to hold serious talks by July 24 over Tokyo’s tighter export controls of high-tech materials to South Korean chipmaking giants imposed early this month. A fire official said the South Korean man who set himself alight outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul died later on Friday at hospital from his injuries.  The 78-year-old man, surnamed Kim, drove up to the building around 3:20 a.m. (1820 GMT Thursday), stopped in front of the gate and set fire to the car while sitting in it, an official at Seoul’s Jongno Fire Station said. The man’s father-in-law was said to be a victim of forced labor by Japanese firms during World War Two and he may have acted in protest against Japan’s export curbs, South Korean media said, quoting the police. Police and fire officials both declined to comment on the man’s possible motivations, citing ongoing investigations.  Compensation of South Koreans for labor during Japan’s 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula has soured relations between the United States’ closest Asian allies. When asked about the possibility of taking the forced labor dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told a regular news conference that Japan has been “considering various measures” but would not comment on the ICJ. Anger over the South Korea-Japan dispute has prompted a widespread boycott of Japanese products and services in South Korea, from beer to clothes and travel, disrupting businesses already facing the worst economic climate in a decade. Japan has said it implemented the export curbs over South Korea’s “deficiencies” in its export control systems and not in reaction to the laborers dispute, but South Korea has called the restrictions “unjust economic retaliation”. Lee Ho-hyeon, a director general at South Korea’s trade ministry, said Japan’s plan to remove South Korea from its “white list” of countries with minimum trade restrictions should be based on “clear evidence and facts.” “There are major concerns that such a move would have a grave impact on not only the economies in both countries, but the global supply chain,” Lee said at a televised briefing. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has sent letters to partners urging them to stockpile more Japanese components in case Tokyo expands its export restrictions.     On Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met major party leaders and vowed to work together to resolve the dispute with Japan. A senior national security adviser told lawmakers at the meeting that South Korea could reconsider an intelligence sharing pact it has with Japan if the dispute worsens, though a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House later said they see the two issues as separate.

“All drones belonging to Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz... returned safely to their bases after their mission of identification and control, and there is no report of any operational response by USS ‘Boxer,’” Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi told the Tansim news agency.Earlier, US President Donald Trump said an Iranian drone was taken down by the ‘Boxer’ after approaching her to within 1,000 yards (900 meters). The Iranian official said the statement was meant to escalate tension and uncertainty in the Strait of Hormuz.Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, suggested that the US military may have taken down their own drone by mistake.We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!Tension has been high in the strategic region since May, when Washington accused Tehran of preparing an unspecified attack on US interests, and deployed additional military assets to the Middle East. The US has also imposed crippling economic sanctions against Iran and has been pressuring other nations to stop buying Iranian crude.Last month, Iran downed a US Navy surveillance drone, saying it had strayed into its airspace.A number of incidents involving oil tankers have also happened over recent months, with Washington and its allies claiming that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps was responsible.Think your friends would be interested?

Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOn Friday 19 October, 1934, the passenger plane Miss Hobart fell from the sky to the sea.Eight men, three women and a baby boy fell with her, swallowed - it's believed - by the waters of the Bass Strait that lies between Tasmania and mainland Australia.The plane's wreckage was never found. One of those on board was a 33-year-old Anglican missionary, Rev Hubert Warren, who had been travelling to his new parish in Enfield, Sydney. His wife Ellie and four children had stayed behind, intending to follow by boat. The reverend's last present to his eight-year-old son, David, had been a crystal radio set that the boy treasured deeply. As a boarder at Launceston Boys' Grammar School in Tasmania, David Warren tinkered with the machine after lessons, learning what made it work. He charged friends a penny to listen to cricket matches, and within a few years was selling home-made copies at five shillings each.Young David was charismatic and a wonderful orator - a boy with star quality. His family, who were deeply religious, dreamed he would become an evangelical preacher. But that was not to be. The gift from Rev Hubert, Man of God, had launched a love affair with Science.It would prove to be of life-saving significance.By his mid-twenties, David Warren had studied his way to a science degree from the University of Sydney, a diploma in education from Melbourne University and a PhD in chemistry from Imperial College, London. His specialty was rocket science, and he went to work as a researcher for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), a part of Australia's Defence Department that focused on planes.  In 1953, the department loaned him to an expert panel trying to solve a costly and distressing mystery: why did the British de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner and the great hope of the new Jet Age, keep crashing? He thought it might be the fuel tanks; but there were dozens of possible causes and nothing but death and debris as evidence. The panel sat down to discuss what they knew."People were rattling on about staff training and pilots' errors, and did a fin break off the tail, and all sorts of things that I knew nothing about," Dr Warren recalled more than 50 years later."I found myself dreaming of something I'd seen the week before at Sydney's first post-war trade fair. And that is - what claimed to be the first pocket recorder, the Miniphon. A German device. There'd been nothing before like it…" The Miniphon was marketed as a dictation machine for businessmen, who could sit at their desks (or on trains and planes) recording letters that would later be typed up by their secretaries. David, who loved swing music and played the clarinet, only wanted one so he could make bootleg recordings of the jazz musician Woody Herman.However, when one of his fellow scientists suggested the latest doomed Comet might have been hijacked, something clicked for him.The chances that a recorder had been on board - and survived the fiery wreck - were basically nil. But what if every plane in the sky had a mini recorder in the cockpit? If it was tough enough, accident investigators would never be this confused again, because they'd have audio right up to the moment of the crash. At the very least, they'd know what the pilots had said and heard. The idea fascinated him. Back at ARL, he rushed to tell his boss about it.Alas, his superior didn't share his enthusiasm. Dr Warren said he was told: "It's nothing to do with chemistry or fuels. You're a chemist. Give that to the instruments group and get on with blowing up fuel tanks."  David knew his idea for a cockpit recorder was a good one. Without official support, there was little he could do about it - but he couldn't get it out of his mind.When his boss was promoted, David pitched his invention again. His new superior was intrigued, and so was Dr Laurie Coombes, ARL's chief superintendent. They urged him to keep working on it - but discreetly. Since it wasn't a government-approved venture or a war-winning weapon, it couldn't be seen to take up lab time or money. Dr Warren said the chief superintendent had cautioned him: "If I find you talking to anyone, including me, about this matter, I will have to sack you."It was a sobering thought for a young man with a wife and two children.But his boss's backing extended to sneakily buying one of the precious new dictation recorders, and chalking it up as "an instrument required for the laboratory…"Encouraged, Dr Warren wrote up his idea in a report, titled "A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents", and sent it out across the industry. The pilots' union responded with fury, branding the recorder a snooping device, and insisted "no plane would take off in Australia with Big Brother listening".That was one of his better reviews.Australia's civilian aviation authorities declared it had "no immediate significance", and the air force feared it would "yield more expletives than explanations". Dr Warren was tempted to pack it all in.But his eldest son, Peter, says his father was stubborn, with a non-conformist streak that coloured his whole worldview. "He took us skiing," he recalls, "but he did the skiing in washing-up gloves, because he wasn't going to pay $30 for a pair of ski gloves. He wasn't the least bit afraid. He wasn't going to wait and follow the herd at all." It was in that spirit that Dr Warren took to his garage and assembled his 20-year-old radio parts. He'd decided the only way to overcome his critics' mockery and suspicion was to build a solid prototype. It would be the first ever "black box" flight recorder. One day in 1958, when the little flight recorder had been finished and finessed, the lab received an unusual visitor. Dr Coombes, the chief superintendent, was showing round a friend from England. "Dave!" he said, "Tell him what you're doing!"Dr Warren explained: his world-first prototype used steel wire to store four hours of pilot voices plus instrument readings and automatically erased older records so it was reusable. There was a pause, then the visitor said: "I say Coombes old chap, that's a damn good idea. Put that lad on the next courier, and we'll show it in London."The courier was a Hastings bomber aircraft, making a run to England. You had to know somebody pretty powerful to get a seat on it. Dr Warren wondered who this man was who was giving away tickets round the world to somebody he'd never met. The answer was Robert Hardingham (later Sir Robert), the secretary of the British Air Registration Board and a former Air Vice-Marshal in the RAF.In David's words: "He was a hero. And he was a friend of Coombes, and if he gave away a seat, you took it."A few weeks later, Dr Warren was on a plane bound for England - with strict instructions not to tell Australia's Department of Defence what he was really doing there, because "somebody would frown on it".In a near-unbelievable irony, the plane lost an engine over the Mediterranean. Dr Warren recalled: "I said, 'Chaps, we seem to have lost a donk - does anyone want to go back?' But we'd come from Tunisia and it was about 45 degrees overnight. We didn't want to go back to that hellhole."They decided they could make it if they ploughed on.He recorded the rest of the flight, thinking that even if he died in that limping bomber, "at least I'd have proved the bastards wrong!""But unfortunately we didn't prang - we just landed safely…" In England, Dr Warren presented "the ARL Flight Memory Unit" to the Royal Aeronautical Establishment and some commercial instrument-makers.The Brits loved it. The BBC ran TV and radio programmes examining it, and the British civil aviation authority started work to make the device mandatory in civil aircraft. A Middlesex firm, S Davall and Sons, approached ARL about the production rights, and kicked off manufacturing. Though the device started to be called "the black box", the first ones off the line were orange so they'd be easier to find after a crash - and they remain so today.Peter Warren believes the name dates from a 1958 interview his father gave the BBC."Right at the end there was a journalist who referred to this as a 'black box'. It's a generic word from electronics engineering, and the name stuck."In 1960, Australia became the first country to make cockpit voice recorders mandatory, after an unexplained plane crash in Queensland killed 29 people. The ruling came from a judicial inquiry, and took a further three years to become law. Today, black boxes are fire-proof, ocean-proof and encased in steel. And they are compulsory on every commercial flight.It's impossible to say how many people owe their lives to data captured in the death throes of a failing plane - to the flaws exposed, and the safety innovations that followed.David Warren worked at ARL until his retirement in 1983, becoming its principal research scientist. He died on 19 July, 2010, at the age of 85. For more than 50 years, his pioneering work on the black box went almost unacknowledged. Finally in 1999, he was awarded the Australian Institute of Energy Medal, and then in 2002 was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his service to the aviation industry. Asked why it took so long for him to be recognised, his daughter Jenny observes: "His battle was inertia. He had this huge enquiring mind, scientifically visionary, and could see how it would work - how it would play out. "He was sitting there in 1958, saying 'this device can make this happen.'"Peter Warren blames "a 1950s colonial mindset which said nothing good could come out of this country, and everything good would get invented in either the UK, or Germany or America".The historic secrecy surrounding ARL's work, which is now more widely understood, is another likely factor.Dr Warren lived to see Qantas name an Airbus A380 after him in 2008. Jenny Warren says she's been trying to get a seat on it ever since.But he never saw a penny in royalties from the black box. He was often asked if he felt hard done by. Peter says his standard response was: "Yes, the government got the results of what I did. But then, they also didn't charge me for the other hundred ideas that didn't work." David's children inherited his sense of humour. At Peter's urging, Dr Warren's death notice included his personal catchphrase: "I'm a lucky bastard."At Jenny's request, he was buried in a casket labelled: "Flight Recorder Inventor: Do Not Open."Do they think of their dad when flying?His daughter replies simply: "Every time."Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world


3 Min ReadMANILA (Reuters) - Opponents of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte expressed shock and outrage on Friday at police moves to charge dozens of them with sedition, calling it persecution aimed at stamping out scrutiny of his increasingly powerful rule. Thirty-six opposition figures are accused of cyber libel and sedition for orchestrating a series of online videos ahead of May’s mid-term elections. The videos feature a hooded man alleging that Duterte and his family members were involved in the illegal drugs trade, which they deny. The man, who had said he was a witness, later surrendered and appeared with police on television to say his claims were false and that he was cajoled into making the videos by opposition members. They included the vice president, lawyers, Catholic priests, a former attorney general, and incumbent and former lawmakers, the man said. The justice department is looking into the complaint, which is the latest move against Duterte’s detractors who say the aim is to create a power monopoly for a president who already enjoys a legislative super-majority and a public approval rating of about 80 percent. Duterte insists he is open to challenges but has shown no qualms about threatening high-profile critics, several of whom he said last month he would jail if they tried to impeach him. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said Duterte had no involvement in the police sedition complaint. “We have nothing to do with this case, not at all, absolutely nothing,” he told news channel ANC. “Let the judicial process do its work.” Antonio Trillanes, a former senator and Duterte’s strongest critic, described the complaint as “political persecution and harassment” intended to stifle democratic dissent. A spokesman for Vice President Leni Robredo, who was not Duterte’s running mate and was elected separately, called the complaint “completely baseless”. Her party ally Senator Francis Pangilinan said it was part of a series of moves toward removing her from office. Leila de Lima, an anti-Duterte senator detained on drugs charges, said it was “hogwash, pure hogwash”, and Samira Gutoc, a candidate in recent Senate elections, urged the police not to become partisan. “I really am baffled,” Gutoc said of being accused of involvement.

President Donald Trump is still threatening to slap duties on another $325 billion of goods. In wake of the intensifying battle, more and more companies announced plans or are considering shifting manufacturing from China.American personal computer makers HP and Dell could move up to 30% of their notebook production in China to Southeast Asia, Nikkei reported. Apple has asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15% to 30% of their production capacity from China to India, according to an earlier report from the Nikkei.Japan's Nintendo is also going to pull a portion of its video game console production from China to Vietnam, according to Nikkei.Not only are foreign companies rethinking its production location, a handful of Chinese companies are also leaving China. Chinese multinational electronics company TCL is moving its TV production to Vietnam, while Chinese tire maker Sailun Tire is transitioning its manufacturing line to Thailand, Nikkei reported.The prolonged trade battle seems to be taking a toll on the Chinese economy. Data on Monday showed its economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter — the weakest rate in at least 27 years.Trump claimed the slower growth is evidence that China is losing the trade war as the country faces an exodus of companies. "The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal," Trump said in a twitter post on Monday.—Click here to read the original story from the Nikkei Asian Review.Got a confidential news tip?

National ReviewOver on the home page I have some thoughts about the true nature of the student-debt “crisis” and some ideas for how to deal with it. Coincidentally, today Josh Hawley announced some very relevant reforms.Per his press release:SEN. HAWLEY: BREAK UP HIGHER EDUCATION MONOPOLY, PROVIDE MORE OPTIONS FOR CAREER TRAININGU.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is introducing two pieces of legislation this week that will expand federal aid for people pursuing vocational education and will put higher education institutions on the hook for students unable to repay student loans.It’s an odd definition of “monopoly” that encompasses a sector with thousands of competing options, but okay: Higher ed is pretty dysfunctional and these reforms target two big problems with it.Hawley’s first bill will “make more job-training and certification programs, like employer-based apprenticeships and digital boot camps, eligible to receive Pell Grants through an alternative accreditation process.” This is a good idea. There’s no reason we should be subsidizing college to the exclusion of other ways to learn important skills.His second bill requires “colleges and universities to pay off 50 percent of the balance of student loans accrued while attending their institution for students who default, and forbids them from increasing the cost of attendance to offset their liability.”The idea of a “money-back guarantee” for college isn’t crazy; it forces schools to take responsibility for their students’ outcomes, rather than accepting students who don’t have the skills to graduate, collecting tuition for a few years, and then sending the kids along poorer, indebted, and lacking a credential.But I’m not sold on the idea of forbidding colleges “from increasing the cost of attendance to offset their liability.” I’m not sure it’s possible to enforce such a rule — and while higher ed in general is inefficient, I’m not sure it’s possible for every college to shoulder a new liability without raising its prices at all. Further, if tuition hikes resulted from this legislation, they would basically “price in” half the school’s default risk, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing.It would be better to require these payments — providing schools a big incentive to be careful about whom they admit and to teach students marketable skills — and let the market handle it from there. Rather than forcing schools to make cuts until they can cover the liability without a tuition hike, let them strike a balance between service cuts and price hikes and compete to see who figured out the best one.Couple other things: Might it encourage students to default if doing so will force their college to “pay off” half their loans, especially once they miss payments for a while and start getting close to that threshold? (The consequences of defaulting are pretty severe, so maybe not, but it’s worth thinking about.) And should colleges be liable for the interest their former students rack up, or just for the money they actually collected in tuition payments etc.?NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.

"China opposes official exchange between the US and Taiwan. This position is firm and clear," the Chinese foreign ministry said on July 12. The U.S. should not to allow Tsai's transit and must "stop the official exchange with Taiwan," said Geng Shuang, spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry.The visit comes on the heels of the U.S. State Department recently approving a $2.2 billion sale of weapons to Taiwan— a self-ruled island viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province that has no right to state-to-state ties.The timing of both is significant and reflects a  "much higher risk tolerance from the Donald Trump administration when it comes to growing U.S.-Taiwan ties, " said Kelsey Broderick, China analyst at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.The U.S. State Department sought to downplay Tsai's visit, describing it as  "private and unofficial."Earlier in July, Tsai transited through New York — another major U.S. city — when she was on her way to the Caribbean. That visit saw her meeting members of the U.S. Congress as well as representatives from Taiwan's 17 remaining diplomatic allies, and speaking at Columbia University. She also addressed a 1,000-strong crowd of supporters, according to the Taipei Times.Her visits come at a low point in U.S.-China relations. In addition to sparring over trade, the world's two biggest economies are also at loggerheads over Taiwan.Washington's ties with the self-ruled island are technically unofficial. But under the Taiwan Relations Act,  "the United States shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character."The U.S. is the main supplier of arms to Taiwan, which has its own democratically elected government and will be buying tanks, missiles and other military equipment as part of the latest deal.Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan and has been ramping up aggressive rhetoric toward the island in a renewed push for reunification, since the two territories were split amid a civil war 70 years ago.In a speech at the start of the year, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for peaceful  "reunification" between China and Taiwan. He said the  "one country, two systems" framework — with which Beijing governs Hong Kong, a Chinese special administrative region — was the best way for Taiwan.Xi's comments triggered a strong response from Tsai, who vowed:  "Taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems.'"Tsai's expressed defiance against that model of autonomy turned her waning popularity around and helped secure a win in her party's presidential primary.Taiwan is the most significant and sensitive issue in U.S.-China relations, the Chinese foreign ministry has previously said.After the U.S. announced its arms deal, China issued a stern warning. "We urge the US ... to cancel this arms sale immediately and stop military ties with Taiwan to prevent further damage to China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," said Geng, the spokesman for the ministry, on July 9.Beijing also threatened to retaliate, and vowed to impose sanctions on U.S. firms selling arms to Taiwan. "If China follows through on sanctioning the US companies involved in the arms sale, it will be the first time it has taken this kind of action," the Eurasia Group said. "In the past, China has punished Taiwan for arms sales from the US, while threatening action against the US but keeping actual penalties informal and discreet."The overall impact of sanctions on the U.S. corporate sector will probably be modest but  "this is still a very significant action," said Broderick and her colleague, Michael Hirson. "It shows the degree to which Taiwan is the most sensitive issue for Xi Jinping, " Eurasia Group said. "The arms sale and Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen's stopover trip to the United States this week are a challenge that Xi felt he needed to respond to."Beijing has so far withheld from harsher actions on Taiwan directly, perhaps out if fear that the move could backfire and instead, bolster support for Tsai, who is seeking a second term in January elections.The Taiwan market has also become increasingly important to China as it suffers from the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict, wrote Broderick in a separate note. "Beijing needs Taiwan's major semiconductor companies to continue supplying to Chinese companies and has stepped up its offering of tax and other residential benefits to Taiwan entrepreneurs who shift operations to the mainland," she added. This is especially important since Chinese tech giant Huawei has been placed on a U.S. blacklist, a move that effectively blocks the company from doing business with U.S. companies — even though the restrictions were eventually eased.And while Beijing desires a trade deal with Washington, it is not so critical to Xi that he is willing to bend on sensitive issues such as Taiwan's independence, said the Eurasia analysts. "Trump's tariff hikes and especially the U.S. export ban on Huawei has heightened nationalist sentiment in China and made Beijing more skeptical that a deal will bring a lasting ebb in tensions," they added.— Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoeing is taking a $4.9bn hit to cover costs related to the worldwide grounding of its 737 Max aircraft.The charge is set to wipe out profits when the world's biggest planemaker posts quarterly results next week.In a statement, Boeing also said its "best estimate at this time" is that the aircraft will return to service in the last three months of this year.A 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October, and another in Ethiopia in March, killed 346 people in total.Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history after its best-selling aircraft was grounded worldwide after the disasters.Crash investigators have concentrated their efforts on the aircraft's control system and Boeing has been working with regulators to roll out a software upgrade. The manufacturer, facing intense scrutiny over the regulatory clearance for the aircraft to fly, has cut the monthly production rate from 52 to 42 as airlines hold off purchases. Most of the $4.9bn charge will be used to compensate Boeing's customers for schedule disruptions and delays in aircraft deliveries.Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent$5bn, and very probably counting.The money set aside by Boeing is meant to cover compensation for customers who either haven't received their aircraft, or can't use the ones they already have.Airlines who are waiting for overdue deliveries are having to make alternative arrangements, by cancelling services, leasing aircraft from specialist companies, or by keeping older, less fuel-efficient models in service for longer. All three options come at a cost.And for those who already had Max aircraft in service, there will be financing costs that still have to be paid, even when the planes themselves are not earning their keep. Not to mention the money that needs to be spent on maintaining them while they are on the ground. All of this, ultimately, is likely to come back to Boeing. The $5bn figure assumes that the process of approving the Max to go back into service will begin in the autumn. But we have already seen that regulators seem determined to take a very tough line when it comes to ensuring the safety of the aircraft. The schedule could well slip again, and costs rise further.Let's not forget either that lawsuits filed by relatives of accident victims are mounting up, and this charge does not take them into consideration at all. So the final bill for Boeing may well be a lot higher.Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, said: "This is a defining moment for Boeing. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes."The Max grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognised this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks." Boeing said it continues to work with aviation authorities to get the 737 Max back into the air, which it hopes will be in the fourth quarter of 2019.But the statement added: "This assumption reflects the company's best estimate at this time, but actual timing of return to service could differ from this estimate." Boeing also warned that if this timetable slips, and its anticipated resumption of deliveries to customers is delayed, that this "could result in additional financial impact".   However, in a speech on Thursday, the US transportation secretary appeared less certain that the aircraft would be cleared to fly again this year.Elaine L Chao said the Federal Aviation Administration, "is following a thorough process, rather than a prescribed timeline... the FAA will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when it is deemed safe to do so." She was not referring directly to Boeing's statement.Analysts knew that Boeing faced a heavy financial cost following the disasters and had been awaiting clarity. Boeing's share price rose 2% in after-hours trading on Wall Street after the announcement, a sign that investors are comfortable with the charge.In April, Boeing halted share buybacks. The planemaker said that lowered production due to the grounding of the 737 Max fleet globally had cost it an additional charge of at least $1bn so far.On Thursday, Southwest Airlines, the biggest user of the 737 Max, joined its US rivals in cancelling more flights until early November. The move also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring.Donald Trump says the ship took "defensive action" in the Strait of Hormuz, as US-Iran tensions rise.15 sayings from around the world


Foreign minister Marise Payne says the government has expressed concern for Yang’s welfare
Michael McGowan and 
Lily Kuo

Foreign minister Marise Payne says the federal government is “deeply disappointed” that Australian writer Yang Hengjun has been transferred to criminal detention in China, saying he should be released if he is being held “for his political views”.Payne issued a statement on Friday saying Australia had received formal notification from Chinese authorities of Yang’s transfer to criminal detention. A Chinese public intellectual who has long advocated for democratic reforms in China, Yang has been detained since January in an unknown location in China.Yang’s lawyer Mo Shaoping said on Friday that his family had received formal notice of his criminal detention on suspicion of endangering national security, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or in more serious cases, the death penalty. Mo said he has been transferred to a facility under Beijing’s state-security bureau.Mo said authorities had previously said Yang’s detention was related to espionage, which falls under the crime of endangering national security.Yang’s wife, Yuan Xiaolong, who was banned this month from leaving the country, is still subject to an exit ban, according to the lawyer. She has been told by authorities not to speak to the foreign media.Payne revealed on Friday that she had twice written to China’s foreign minister, state councillor Wang Yi, calling for “a fair and transparent resolution” to Yang’s situation, and for him to be granted access to his lawyers.“This has not occurred,” she said on Friday.“The government has expressed concern about Dr Yang’s welfare and the conditions under which he is held. And we have asked for clarification regarding the reasons for Dr Yang’s detention. If he is being detained for his political views, then he should be released.“We have worked tirelessly and in good faith with the Chinese government to advocate for Dr Yang’s interests since he was detained. We expect basic standards of justice and procedural fairness to be met.“The Australian government is concerned by this development in relation to an Australian citizen. We will continue to press Chinese authorities for fair and humane treatment, in accordance with international norms. Our thoughts are with Dr Yang and his family during this difficult period.”Payne said Australian embassy officials had visited Yang on six occasions, most recently on 27 June.“The Australian government is deeply disappointed that Australian citizen and academic Dr Yang Hengjun has been transferred to criminal detention in China,” the foreign minister said.“The Australian government has raised its concerns about Yang’s case regularly with China at senior levels.”The elevation in rhetoric from Australia comes amid tensions between the two countries over concerns about potential Chinese interference in national affairs, Huawei and human rights.This week Payne, said Australia was “deeply concerned” about Beijing’s treatment of Uighurs, an ethnic minority in Xinjiang.Payne said China had blocked Australia’s attempts to offer consular assistance to dual citizens and their families believed detained in Xinjiang.Labor’s acting shadow foreign minister, Richard Marles, echoed the government’s call for Yang to be released if he was being held for his political views.“We call on the Chinese government to clarify the reasons for Dr Yang’s detention and to ensure Dr Yang is treated in a fair, unbiased and transparent manner,” he said.Yang, a former Chinese diplomat, is a popular writer and blogger known for his spy novels and political commentary.He is known in online circles as minzhu xiaofan, or “democracy peddler”. “I’m like an old auntie jabbering on, always promoting democracy and repeating its benefits,” he wrote in an article in 2014.“Dictatorship is always torn down in one night, but good democracy isn’t built in one night.”Human Rights Watch has urged the government to “vigorously press” for Yang’s release.


The sailor, whose name is being withheld in accordance with navy policy, was reported overboard on Wednesday. Search parties from the Lincoln and the cruiser USS Leyte Gulf are looking for the missing man, assisted by the Spanish frigate Mendez Nunez and the Pakistani frigate Aslat.The news comes amid reports that amphibious assault ship USS Boxer entered the Persian Gulf and shot down an Iranian drone. The Lincoln and her accompanying ships were deployed to the region in May, amid rising tensions between the US and Iran. The task force has been conducting “simulated strike operations” in preparations for a possible US attack on Iran.As part of the drills, the Lincoln’s air wing conducted joint operations with the US Air Force’s B-52 strategic bombers, which the air wing commander described as “an incredible demonstration of how our military can rapidly join capabilities to enhance our lethality.”After Iran shot down a US spy drone over the Straits of Hormuz in late June, the US almost launched a strike in retaliation. US President Donald Trump said he called it off due to concerns about possible Iranian casualties, however.The Trump administration has imposed extensive economic sanctions against Iran after unilaterally exiting the international nuclear deal in May 2018. Tehran has denounced the embargo as aggression.Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!RT News App© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2019.

By his own admission, Paludan had to “step about 10 metres to the side” for the sake of his livestream.Then, three masked people dashed at the party leader, whereupon the police officers had to step in and draw their weapons.“Stop, stop, get away”, the police are heard shouting in a video posted by Stram Kurs.In another clip, Paludan explained that the police were forced to evacuate him immediately.“This is the first time in Danish history that the police are forced to pull firearms to protect a politician”, Paludan declared.Stram Kurs was founded in 2017 and identifies as “ethno-nationalist” and by its own admission campaigns to reach “a Denmark for Danes”. This year, it skyrocketed from a fringe party to national prominence through its “free speech” demonstrations in troubled migrant areas. As the party has made a habit of burning the Quran during its public meetings, their demonstrations have often sparked riots despite police surveillance.Rasmus Paludan is seen as a highly controversial figure by the Danish establishment, even by fellow right-wingers. Stram Kurs advocates banning Islam in Denmark, expelling refugees and cancelling Danish citizenship for non-European immigrants. Paludan himself has repeatedly warned against Danes becoming a minority in their own country.In the 2019 general election, Stram Kurs barely missed the parliamentary threshold of 2 percent.Sputnik push notificationsWe are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.Please review our Privacy Policy.

    Fazoli's President and CEO Carl Howard explains why the abrupt minimum wage increase being proposed by 2020 Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders would be 'catastrophic' for small businesses.Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has pledged to American workers that he would institute a $15-per-hour minimum wage if he wins the White House in 2020.But unionized workers on Sanders’ own campaign say they wish he would start now -- by paying a higher wage to them.According to a report, members of Sanders’ staff have been using the senator's own campaign rhetoric against him as they try to wrestle more pay from the self-described democratic socialist.BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HIS $40 TRILLION MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN WOULD HELP US SAVE MONEYIn a letter to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, the campaign staffers claim they “cannot be expected to build the largest grassroots organizing program in American history while making poverty wages,” the Washington Post reported.“Given our campaign’s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour,” the letter continues, “we believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team.”“Given our campaign’s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour, we believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team.”According to the Post, field organizers claim that their long hours working on behalf of Sanders drop their actual pay to about $13 per hour.“Many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially,” the union letter says, “which is severely impacting our team’s productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.”“Many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially, which is severely impacting our team’s productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.”But when contacted by the Post on Thursday, Shakir seemed to paint a different picture.“We know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns, as is shown by the latest fundraising reports,” Shakir said in a statement, according to the Post. “Every member of the campaign, from the candidate on down, joined this movement in order to defeat Donald Trump and transform America. Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president.”“Every member of the campaign, from the candidate on down, joined this movement in order to defeat Donald Trump and transform America. Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president.”As for Sanders himself, the Post said it was unclear whether the candidate was aware of the grievances among his campaign staff.The Post report surfaced on the same day that the Democrat-controlled House voted in favor of a bill to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009.The situation in the Sanders campaign seems a far cry from March, when Sanders’ campaign proudly announced that its employees had chosen to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400. In May, the campaign ratified a union contract with the workers, making it the first presidential campaign in history to do so.At the time, the campaign touted "unprecedented standards for campaign workers," including pay transparency, a defined wage scale, access to mental health care coverage, an anti-discrimination policy that protects immigrant and transgender staff members, and a "pro-worker grievance and arbitration process.”Meanwhile, President Trump has offered a different perspective on conditions facing U.S. workers.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDuring a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., earlier this week, the president said 6 million new jobs had been created in the U.S. since he was elected and the nation’s unemployment rate of 3.7 percent was at its lowest point in decades.Republican leaders have said a minimum wage hike would be “devastating” for middle-class families, citing research from the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO report found that the Democrats’ bill would boost wages for about 17 million people – but it would also reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce the nation’s output. Overall, the CBO said the move would reduce real family income by about $9 billion in 2025 – or 0.1 percent.Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer and Fox Business’ Brittany De Lea contributed to this story.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

I'm still trying to process it all."Hertfordshire Police said it was investigating and no-one had been arrested.An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said: "There were a number of people in the area at the time and 17 people are presently being treated for injuries, some of which are serious."A group called Cruise-Herts had said it was holding a cruise event on Thursday where people would gather to look at modified cars.Organiser Rix Sidhu said he had been organising similar meets for 17 years and the gathering on Thursday was to raise money for charity.He estimated one of the cars that crashed was travelling at 60 or 70mph and then went into the crowd "at speed".Mr Sidhu said: "We held the meet in a car park with a speed bump at the entrance. But unfortunately some people went a bit rogue."We try and stop that, we urge people...not to go out on the roads, not to risk injury or anything."But unfortunately, in this age of social media and Snapchat, people want to get footage and post things to their friends, which seems to drive some people to the main road."Ciaran O'Connor, 33, said he had been travelling home when he saw the "horrific" crash.He said: "We saw the fast car coming towards them and there was just a scene of kids lying in the road, some of them motionless and people around them trying to help them. "It was horrific."Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews had cut free one person trapped in a vehicle and provided "trauma care" to a number of injured people. The air ambulance was also sent to the scene. Did you witness the crash?

    Indiana has double the rate of child abuse than the national average, a federal agency reported. Here's how to protect children from sexual abuse and other harm.
    Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.comINDIANAPOLIS – IUPUI's former longtime volleyball coach — who was in his 22nd season when he was charged with 11 felony counts of possession of child pornography — will serve no prison time, despite having hundreds of sexually explicit images and videos of young girls.Instead, Steven Payne, of Indianapolis, has been sentenced to four years of probation, is not allowed internet access at home or at work and is required to take part in psychological and mental health treatment and evaluation. Steven Craig Payne registered last month as a sex offender. (Photo: Marion County Sheriff's Department)Payne, 55, had 146 images and videos of child pornography on two thumb drives when police arrested him in November, according to court documents. Police at the time said there were multiple images on each video and estimated Payne had nearly 200 images of underage girls in his possession.During an interview at his home, Payne told police he had videos of girls "possibly under the age of 18," Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Detective Kurt Spivey wrote in an affidavit.A detective found about 120 videos and images of possible child pornography on a thumb drive taken from Payne's backpack, court documents said. Police also found about 26 videos of child pornography on another thumb drive, Spivey said in the probable cause affidavit.Court files: FBI tied Donald Trump and top aides to 2016 effort to silence a porn starPayne was charged with 11 felony counts — including one level 5 felony count of possession of child pornography with an aggravating factor, meaning the nature of the image was more exploitative — which could have been punishable by up to 31 years in prison.But Payne pleaded guilty in March to the most serious charge, the level 5 felony, in exchange for having the other 10 counts dismissed. The level 5 felony carried a sentencing range of one to six years, according to Indiana law. The Marion County Prosecutor's office told IndyStar that during the sentencing hearing, "the state argued that the defendant should serve his sentence in the Indiana Department of Correction. Ultimately, the court imposed a four-year suspended sentence followed by four years of probation," said spokesman Michael Leffler of the prosecutor's office. "This gives me control over him for a longer period of time," Marion Superior Court Judge Grant W. Hawkins, who presided over the case, told IndyStar.A sentence of four years in prison could have meant Payne would be free from supervision much earlier.Avenatti: R. Kelly paid $2 million to prevent testimony in 2008 child porn trial"The plea agreement capped initial incarceration at two years," he said. "With a two-year sentence, he’s out in 18 months or less."The agreement did allow for a sentence in excess of two years if Hawkins suspended the jail time."Four years of probation is four years of probation," he said. "It can't be reduced." During that time, Payne will be subject to polygraph testing and searches. He will not be allowed to have devices that have internet access or use of social media.If Payne violates his probation at any time, Hawkins said, "I can still put him in (prison).""In addition to this sentence, his life is ruined," Hawkins said. "He won’t work in his field. He won't coach. He won't work in education. He will have to find something else to do for a career." When asked how Payne received no prison time, Frances Lee Watson, a professor of law at Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law, said: "What comes to my mind is that (Payne's) lawyer did a great job. "(Though), it is not unusual to plead away multiple counts."Payne's attorney, Dorothy Maryan, told IndyStar she would not comment on the case.Steve Payne, head coach of the IUPUI volleyball team, was arrested Wednesday on a charge of child pornography, court records show. (Photo: Provided by IMPD)Police first learned of Payne after an image of possible child pornography was uploaded to a chat room in 2016. The image was eventually traced to Payne’s IP address, court documents said.In November, IMPD officers executed a search warrant at Payne’s office in the IUPUI Athletics/Military Science Building, the affidavit said.While there, Spivey searched Payne and his backpack, found and seized two thumb drives, two laptops and other devices, the affidavit said.Payne was sentenced on June 14 to four years of probation after the judge suspended his prison time. Payne had been in jail three days before bonding out for $10,000. When asked how a man with 11 felony counts and nearly 200 images could serve no other time behind bars, Hawkins said he has to differentiate between possession and producing and disseminating."With possession, there is a separator between him and the victim," he said. "With the other, the victim is in the room. That's a whole different deal."Court documents: Hope Hicks in contact with Michael Cohen during hush-money discussionsAlicia Kozakiewicz disagrees. "There is this fallacy, this belief that viewing images and videos is a victimless crime and that is absolutely not true," she said. Kozakiewicz is the director of outreach and global impact at the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which works to eradicate child abduction, sexual abuse and exploitation."Thinking about how many victims that is, that's terrible," she said .Kozakiewicz said this crime is personal for her. At age 13, she was a victim of a child pornography case that garnered national attention when she was abducted. Over the course of four days, she was held captive, shackled, raped, and tortured. The man who kidnapped her filmed the abuse and broadcast it online, live via streaming video for others to watch.A sentence such as the one Payne was given is likely not going to stop him from being a repeat offender as he basically got off "unscathed," Kozakiewicz said.  "He can go start a new life," she said.Payne asked the judge to let him complete his probation in Florida, according to court documents. The judge agreed."Defendant can transfer probation to Florida upon completion of a sex offender program or if Florida has an equivalent sex offender program," Hawkins wrote in his comments. "Florida must agree to accept the defendant. Defendant is not allowed internet access at home or work." The same day he was sentenced, Payne registered as a sex offender in Indiana.After Payne was taken into custody Nov. 8, he was fired from his coaching position at IUPUI. In February, the school hired then-assistant coach Lindsey Buteyn as the new head volleyball coach. She had taken the position on an interim basis after Payne was terminated.Follow Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 


5 Min ReadSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Thursday it would take an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion in the second quarter on estimated disruptions from the prolonged grounding of its lucrative 737 MAX passenger jets after two deadly crashes. The charge is from “potential concessions and other considerations to customers,” and the impact of continued lower production, the world’s largest planemaker said in a statement, as airlines that use the planes extend flight cancellations until November. The charge will result in a $5.6 billion reduction in revenue and pre-tax earnings in the second quarter, Boeing said.     Boeing shares rose 2 percent in after-hours trading, which Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said was a sign that investors were comfortable with the size of the charge and  Boeing’s production plans, disclosed less than a week before the company plans to release quarterly financial results on July 24. “The company showed a degree of confidence in a return to service before year-end and getting up to 57 per month on 737 production in about 12 months, which investors were increasingly skeptical of,” Lalwani said. Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history as its fastest-selling jetliner has been grounded since March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that together killed 346 people in a span of five months.  The Chicago-based planemaker is now reckoning with a blow to its reputation as well as the financial cost of getting its planes back in the air. “We are taking appropriate steps to manage our liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility the best way possible as we are working through these challenges,” Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a statement. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a tweet that the company remains focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service.  “The MAX grounding presents significant challenges for our customers, company and supply chain,” he tweeted. The grounding of the 737 MAX has sent shockwaves through the industry and pushed back the launch of a new Boeing aircraft - a twin-aisle jet for the middle of the market known as NMA. Boeing’s board is unlikely to give the project a green light until it has a full picture of the financial exposure caused by the 737 crisis, industry sources say. Boeing also said estimated costs to produce its flagship single-aisle aircraft increased by $1.7 billion in the second quarter, driven primarily by higher costs from a longer-than-expected reduction in its aircraft production rate.  Boeing reduced the number of single-aisle aircraft it produces monthly in the Seattle area from 52 to 42 following the second crash in Ethiopia while suspending deliveries of the aircraft to airlines, which cuts off fresh cash infusions and hits margins. The lower rate means Boeing has to pay more for parts, which are priced according to the volume Boeing buys. Boeing said it was working toward building 57 of the 737s a month in 2020. When it reported first-quarter results in April, Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production because the grounding had cost it at least $1 billion so far. But the fuller picture of how much the grounding will cost Boeing, and how it plans to repair its image with the flying public, was not expected until the end of the second quarter since 737 production cuts did not begin until mid-April.  Boeing also said it assumes the 737 MAX return to service in the United States and other countries beginning early in the fourth quarter, though the company cautioned the exact timeline could shift as it has in recent weeks. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) joined U.S. rivals on Thursday in canceling more flights until early November, which has also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring. United Airlines, with 14 MAX jets, posted quarterly earnings on Tuesday that showed a boost in unit revenues thanks to reduced seat capacity in the sector, though costs are seen spiking over the year due to the grounding.    Boeing is facing a slew of probes by regulators across the world as well as U.S. lawmakers and the Department of Justice. Reporting by Eric M.

"It felt like there was something going on beyond just political disagreement” on the House floor on Tuesday during the contentious vote, chaplain Rev. Patrick Conroy told CNN on Thursday. “The energy of the House was very off. No one was relishing what was happening."Conroy’s prayer was inspired by the Catholic exorcism rite, he explained – as well as “traditional blessings for homes or other buildings.” He had the idea after witnessing Tuesday’s chaotic vote on a resolution condemning Trump’s “racist” tweets degenerate into partisan sniping. The drama unfolded before the vote itself, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi ultimately leaving the room in a huff after Republican Rep. Doug Collins demanded she retract the characterization of Trump’s tweets as racist. Presiding Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver dropped the gavel and abandoned the chair, a dramatic move with no historical precedent, as the proceedings devolved into bickering over whether a rule had been broken.

    President Trump says the U.S. shot down an Iranian drone that was threatening the USS Boxer Naval ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
    APIran denied Friday it lost a drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the United States said it had "destroyed" an Iranian drone that was threatening a U.S. ship."We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) by mistake!," Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Twitter. Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted military spokesman Gen. Abolfazl Shekari as saying that "all Iranian drones that are in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, including the one which the U.S. president mentioned, after carrying out scheduled identification and control missions, have returned to their bases."The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic waterway for the seaborne transportation of about a fifth of the world's global crude oil exports.  President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the drone was threatening a U.S. ship and was "immediately destroyed." He said the drone came within 1,000 yards and ignored "multiple calls to stand down.""This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters," the president said. "The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities, and interests."He called on other countries to condemn Iran's "attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce.""I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the strait and to work with us in the future," Trump said.
    President Donald Trump commented on Iran, the census, migrants, the British ambassador to the United States and the U.S. national team's win in the Women's World Cup on Sunday. (July 8)
    AP, APPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, was in international waters in the Strait at roughly 10 a.m. local time when a drone approached and "closed within a threatening range.""The ship took defensive action against the (drone) to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew," he said.The apparent downing of the drone followed Iran's apparent seizure of an oil tanker, the nation's state media announced Thursday. Twelve crew members were on the Panamanian-flagged vessel when it was taken near the Strait of Hormuz. The Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful organization with links to the military and business, said the tanker tried to smuggle a million liters of oil.Tensions have escalated since the United States pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions.Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace, an assertion U.S. officials said was false. The president pulled back on a planned retaliatory strike against Iranian targets at the last minute. U.S. officials at the time cautioned the move should not be interpreted as weakness.   The amphibious assault ship USS Boxer is seen in San Diego Bay in San Diego, Calif., on May 1, 2019. (Photo: AP)"Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness," National Security Adviser John Bolton said during a trip to Jerusalem. "No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East. As President Trump said Friday, our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go."On Tuesday, Trump's nominee to be the next defense secretary, Army Secretary Mark Esper, told lawmakers the United States is pursuing a strategy of "passive patrolling" in the area with coalition partners as part of an initiative dubbed "Operation Sentinel."He said the goal was to try to and deter further provocative actions by Iran."At the same time, from the highest levels of government from the president himself, we said we will meet anytime, anywhere, without precondition to discuss issues with the Iranians to get us on the diplomatic path," he said.Iran’s Foreign Minster Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in New York on Thursday that Iran would offer a deal to the U.S. in which it would offer it enhanced inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for the permanent lifting of economic sanctions.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.A report by Dr Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, warned that “the inability of politicians to manage Brexit competently and decisively” was undermining faith in the political system.“When people feel that the system is broken, they look outside of it and step into a political arena where the far right is able to capitalise on these fears, offering simplistic answers to complex problems,” the report said.Dr Mulhall warned that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the far-right will “use the narrative of betrayal to advance their politics for the next 10 years”.He told The Independent: “If there is a hard Brexit and these communities get hit, they will come up with an excuse and say something went wrong, we didn’t leave strongly enough. “If we stay in, it’s been betrayed. The far-right will be using this, regardless of what happens.”Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is among the high-profile extremists capitalising on anger over the delay to Brexit.After being appointed as a senior adviser to Ukip’s former leader Gerard Batten last year, he said he was “jumping on the Brexit bandwagon” and then ran as an independent MEP.“The people I know who voted didn’t think about the economy, they thought more about their culture and their identity,” Robinson told crowds at the Ukip-organised Brexit Betrayal March in December.“Let this be the start of a political mass movement in this country to represent every single one of you who feels voiceless.”One supporter in the crowd was carrying a hanging scaffold and noose, while other protesters waved placards accusing politicians of “treason” and chanted abuse at the media.Robinson’s first imprisonment for contempt of court in May 2018 had already triggered demonstrations that drew tens of thousands of his supporters to the streets, and a fresh protest against his second sentence is scheduled for 3 August.Dr Mulhall said the event could see a significant turnout, despite Robinson’s reach being damaged by his imprisonment and a series of social media bans, as organisers mobilise anger against the “establishment”.“There’s little doubt that no matter which side of the Brexit debate you fall on, the failure to deal with it competently has fed into disillusionment and anger,” he added.“We’ve seen through polling that people are increasingly disillusioned with all political parties and leaders, but they are still angry and want change. So they’re looking for alternatives, and for some of them that is Tommy Robinson.”YouGov polling released earlier this month suggested that 56 per cent of Conservative Party members believe Islam was “generally a threat” to the British way of life, while two thirds believed in the myth of no-go zones where “non-Muslims are not able to enter”.Dr Mulhall said the research suggested that large portions of the British public agree with views espoused by anti-Muslim figures like Robinson, and any politician that repeats them “without the far-right baggage” may enjoy election success – “whether that’s Boris Johnson talking about women as letterboxes or someone who hasn’t popped on the scene yet”.He cautioned that concerns exploited by the far right, over employment, immigration, grooming gangs and terrorism, must be addressed by the government to avoid economically disadvantaged parts of Britain becoming a “wellspring for far-right activism”.The research found that Britain’s biggest right-wing extremist groups had modernised themselves by moving away from explicit antisemitism, through anti-immigration rhetoric and broad racism, to focus specifically on Muslims.“The far right has adapted its message and adopted a platform that is more palatable to the public, within the confines of acceptability,” it said, detailing how groups were repurposing the notion of free speech to present themselves as human rights activists and freedom fighters.“Those who publicly limit their racism to Muslims, bemoan the supposed suppression of their rights and freedoms and claim to represent the oppressed “people” versus a corrupt “elite” echo the views of much larger sections of the British public and thus have found success in attracting larger numbers than at any time since the 1930s.”The research was one of four papers on the far-right, commissioned by the new Commission for Countering Extremism, which was set up by the government in 2017 and has been conducting nationwide research on people’s views and experiences of extremism ever since.Sara Khan, the lead commissioner, said the findings “paint a picture of the breadth and severity of the far-right, and the need for proportionate, open-minded responses”. “We have to guard our right to protest and offend but I believe we can and must do more,” she added. “These ideas and threats never went away, and we must redouble our efforts to counter them.“We want this research, and the other papers we release over the summer, to build an evidence-led consensus on the problems we face from extremism, and find even better ways of countering it.”Sajid Javid was to set out his response to the findings at a speech in central London on Friday morning. “Anyone can challenge the myths peddled by extremists that deepen divisions,” the home secretary was to say. “If we are to stop extremism in its tracks we must have the courage to confront it, the strength to take decisive action, and the foresight to tackle the root causes.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

Deze pagina is geprint op 01-01-1970. The Dutch State bears very limited liability in the ‘Mothers of Srebenica’ case. That liability is limited to 10 percent of the damages suffered by the surviving relatives of approximately 350 victims. That is what the Supreme Court ruled today.The case The case regards the events surrounding the fall of the city of Srebrenica on 11 July 1995 and the subsequent evacuation from Dutchbat’s ‘mini safe area’ in the days that followed. The main issue was whether the Dutch State could be held (fully or partly) liable to the surviving relatives of the Muslim men who were murdered at that time by Bosnian Serbs. The surviving relatives believe that Dutchbat did too little to repulse the Bosnian Serbs’ advance and protect the population. They also contend that Dutchbat acted unlawfully by cooperating with the evacuation of the refugees who had fled to Dutchbat’s mini safe area in Potočari. During the evacuation on 12 and 13 July 1995, the Bosnian Serbs murdered the male refugees after separating them from the other refugees.Judgment of the Court of AppealThe Hague Court of Appeal held that the State had acted unlawfully in two respects. First, during the evacuation on 13 July 1995, the State allowed the refugees to be guided to the buses in groups and through a sluice which made it easier for the Bosnian Serbs to separate the male refugees from the rest. Second, the approximately 350 male refugees who were found to be in the compound at the end of the afternoon on 13 July 1995 were not offered the option to remain at the compound. As a result, according to the Court of Appeal, this group of refugees was denied a 30 percent chance of avoiding abuse and execution. The State was thus held liable for 30 percent of the damages suffered by the surviving relatives.CassationBoth the State and the surviving relatives instituted appeals in cassation.Judgment of the Supreme CourtLike the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the State’s liability for Dutchbat’s acts until the start of the evacuation on 12 July 1995. Up to that point, Dutchbat was operating under the responsibility of the United Nations (UN). Under international law, that entails that the acts of the Dutchbat must be construed as acts of the UN, and not of the Netherlands. Therefore, the Dutch State cannot be liable for the events that led to the fall of the city of Srebrenica.As the city of Srebrenica fell on 11 July 1995, approximately 25,000 refugees sought refuge at Dutchbat. Some stayed in the compound and some stayed in an adjacent area that was cordoned off with tape and armoured vehicles (collectively: the mini safe area). The conditions in the mini safe area were appalling. The UN and the State decided to evacuate the refugees and Dutchbat. From that point forward, the State exercised effective control over Dutchbat’s conduct and Dutchbat’s actions were attributable to the State. The refugees were evacuated under Dutchbat’s guidance starting on the afternoon of Wednesday, 12 July 1995. Starting on the evening of 12 July, Dutchbat knew that after the male refugees had been separated from the rest of the refugees by the Bosnian Serbs, they would be at real risk of abuse and execution. That knowledge thus existed when Dutchbat continued evacuating the refugees from the mini safe area outside the compound on the morning of Thursday, 13 July. In the judgment of the Supreme Court, the continuation of that evacuation was not wrongful. The fate of the refugees would not have been changed had Dutchbat stopped cooperating, because the Bosnian Serbs would have continued the evacuation in some other way. Discontinuing that guidance would not have affected the risk to the male refugees who remained outside the compound because they could not hide. Even if Dutchbat had stopped guiding the evacuation, therefore, the Bosnian Serbs would still have separated these men from the other refugees and taken them away. Dutchbat’s choice to continue providing guidance in order to prevent women and children from being trampled was not wrongful.According to the Supreme Court, however, the State did act wrongfully in relation to the evacuation of the 5,000 refugees who were still at the compound itself in the late afternoon of 13 July 1995. Amongst those refugees were 350 men of whom the Bosnian Serbs were unaware because they could not see them. Dutchbat failed to offer these 350 male refugees the choice to stay where they were, even though that would have been possible. This failure on Dutchbat’s part denied these male refugees the chance to stay out of the hands of the Bosnian Serbs. That was wrongful because Dutchbat knew that the male refugees were in serious jeopardy of being abused and murdered by the Bosnian Serbs, and all possible action should have been taken to prevent such an outcome. The chance that the male refugees would have escaped the Bosnian Serbs had they been given the choice to stay was slim, but not negligible. During inspections, the Bosnian Serbs would almost certainly have discovered that male refugees had remained on the compound. They would have subsequently done everything in their power to deport them from the compound, with all the ensuing consequences. The chance of Dutchbat receiving effective support from the international community was slim. The Supreme Court estimates that the male refugees had a ten percent chance of escaping from the Bosnian Serbs, had they been offered the choice to remain in the compound. The Supreme Court estimated this chance at 10 percent, and thus more limited than the 30 percent chance arrived at by the Court of Appeal.The State’s liability is thus limited to 10 percent of the damages suffered  by the surviving relatives of these 350 male refugees. These surviving relatives may claim compensation from the State.

                    Supporting free enterprise and conservative valuesGone are the old breedThe Squad is a real threat — to DemocratsThe best way to fix the U.S. armed forces’ recruiting challenges may involve dipping further into the nation’s high schools.As the Army, Navy and other services contend with a thriving economy and a directive to expand their ranks, there is a growing debate over whether the military should consider lowering the minimum enlistment age from 17 to 16. More than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom, already have adopted the policy.Critics say the idea is deeply flawed and presents a host of societal problems, but supporters argue that the Pentagon needs to think outside the box if it wants to continually overcome one of the toughest recruiting environments in decades.Neither the military nor lawmakers have given any indication that they are entertaining the idea, but some analysts say that opening the ranks to younger Americans could provide unique benefits and may be the kind of fundamental overhaul the recruiting system needs for the 21st century.“For one, many of the factors that disqualify older youths from joining — like criminal records — are not as present in younger teens,” said Shane McCarthy, chief marketing officer of Sandboxx, a leading technology platform that connects military members stationed abroad with families and friends at home. Mr. McCarthy also has advised military commands on how to better target recruits.“Currently, of the 75% of 17- to 24-year-olds who are ineligible to serve, for example, 10% are ineligible due to criminal records,” he wrote in a recent piece for the Military Times. “And, according to the Department of Justice, there are twice as many arrests of 18- to 20-year-olds as there are arrests of 15- to 17-year-olds.”Mr. McCarthy’s argument touched off a firestorm, with skeptics saying the move could create more problems than it would solve. Peter Warren Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington think tank New America, countered that lowering the enlistment age to 16 would undermine combat effectiveness and unit cohesion and create other problems.Mr. Singer, author of the book “Children at War,” also said the very idea shows a “misunderstanding [of] the different brain chemistry of youths and their ability to make informed judgment” and would destroy “the day-to-day lives of the poor drill instructors and commanders of these teens’ first unit.”He made his case in a piece for the military-focused website Task & Purpose.Despite those and other concerns, the notion certainly isn’t new. At least 13 nations allow enlistees younger than 17, according to the CIA World Factbook. They include major powers such as the United Kingdom and smaller countries with much less capable militaries, such as Tonga, Bolivia and Papua New Guinea.In the U.S., analysts say, there is a lack of data about the issue and it’s unclear exactly what effects military services would encounter if they begin admitting younger teens.“I think the broader answer about all of this is we really don’t know,” said Beth J. Asch, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. who studies military recruiting. “There’s no current research on what the effects would be, how would it expand the market, their qualifications. We don’t know.”Like other analysts, Ms. Asch said she believes the idea of signing up 16-year-olds has been off the table for decades and remains so today.But the discussion underscores the armed forces’ systemic recruiting challenges.Last year, the Army fell short of its recruiting goal for the first time in a decade. The Army had set a goal of 76,500 recruits and pulled in just under 70,000, according to Defense Department figures.The Army and all other branches of the military expect to meet this year’s targets, but officials readily acknowledge that the recruiting environment is as difficult as ever, largely because of a soaring economy, a consistently low unemployment rate and more economic opportunities in the private sector for young Americans who otherwise might consider military service.Analysts say that recruiting 16-year-olds doesn’t seem to be the right solution, but they stress that the military can and must improve its outreach to younger teenagers.“You have to compete and be in the marketplace, and that’s something the military doesn’t do very well,” said Rebecca Burgess, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies military and veterans issues. “It tells the story of itself that’s very traditional: ‘We’re freedom fighters doing good throughout the world; be part of our team.’ And it expects people to kind of come to them.”That, she said, is why recruiting offices too often are found in dying shopping malls or other low-traffic sites rather than out in the community.The military has taken serious steps in recent years to increase its visibility and engagement in the nation’s communities. The Army has launched a comprehensive recruiting program in major cities and said the approach already has paid huge dividends in the number of recruits from urban centers such as Baltimore and Minneapolis.But analysts say the military’s past tack of using marketing slogans such as the Army’s “Be all you can be” mantra no longer works.Instead, they say, the branches should craft multiple appeals centering on the host of benefits that come from military service, including educational assistance, patriotism, career benefits, and the host of jobs a man or woman can perform in the military outside of a combat zone.“I think what’s happening now — and it’s not that messages aren’t important — but I think there’s a realization that different people are interested in different things,” said Ms. Asch. “It’s not one message. People want to join for a variety of reasons, so the message has to be somewhat tailored.“The trick is to communicate all of that so people get the message they need to hear,” she said.Copyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Image: Twitter/@jchaltiwanger Every couple of months, photos from FaceApp—a face-editing app that uses neural network to make users look younger, older, more feminine, or more masculine—goes viral. Two years ago, it rolled out a racist face-altering feature that made people into racist caricatures of different races. This week, the app’s viral filter was its aging feature, which makes users look like they’re elderly. Within a few hours, the Twitter conversation about FaceApp became centered on one thing: the app is made by a Russian company based in Saint Petersburg, the implication being that it must be a data collection front for the Russian government. Now, FaceApp’s privacy policy is bad. But it’s also not uniquely bad for an app that uses image data, and it’s not bad  because the company that created the app is Russian. However, the traits of this bad privacy policy are remarkably similar to many American-owned and operated apps. Weather apps. Horoscope apps. Health apps. Fitness apps.  In order to work, FaceApp requires a user to hand over access to their entire camera roll, at which point the app automatically identifies images with faces. It doesn’t allow you to only permit camera access and take, say, one photo to be used by the app, or to upload individual photos to be filtered. FaceApp also collects a variety of personally identifiable information, including “information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data.” It provides this data to vaguely-defined "Affiliates" and "Service Providers," or parties that monitor the "effectiveness" of the app, "develop and test new products," track app metrics, and "diagnose or fix technology problems.” In other words, FaceApp reserves the right to share its information across several broad categories that could include several different types of companies. Notably, FaceApp also gives user data to "third-party advertising partners." “This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you,” the privacy policy states. Notably, in a statement to TechCrunch, FaceApp said, “We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority.” “Even though the core R&D team is located in Russia,” FaceApp told TechCrunch, “the user data is not transferred to Russia.”  Extracting data from unsuspecting users, selling and sharing that data god-knows-where, and justifying it by providing users unreadable privacy policies is a near-universal practice. It transcends Cold War phobias. It’s not Russian. It’s not American. It’s a fundamentally capitalist practice. Companies can only provide free apps and profit if they scrape and share data from the people that use it. The fear of Russian apps seems to be in the same spirit as #ResistanceTwitter’s obsession with the Mueller Report. The discourse strayed from questioning corruption in the executive office of the U.S. government to incoherent chatter about shadowy “Russians.” The fact remains we have no idea how FaceApp is using this data, just like we don't know how lots of other apps are using our data. It should all be concerning, but FaceApp is not  uniquely concerning.  There’s a legitimate discussion that we should have about how much data we hand over the private entities for the sake of mild entertainment. It’s useless to cloud that discussion with the latest American iteration of a Red Scare. 


By using this site, you agree to our updated Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.Tampa-based community radio station WMNF 88.5-FM is stepping up cybersecurity after its computer systems were hobbled by ransom-seeking hackers last month.Interim general manager Cindy Reichard said the ordeal began June 18 when a programmer noticed a computer in one of the studios was acting strangely.The station then received a digital message: Your files have been encrypted. Pay us, and you can have them back.It’s known as a ransomware attack, a common form of cyber crime where hackers install malicious code rendering a victim’s data useless until they pay for a digital key to decrypt it.The station did not pay the ransom, and instead reported the attack to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.“FDLE told us that a lot of times you pay and you still don’t get your data back anyway,” Reichard said.The hack did not affect any sensitive data, such as donor information, payroll or any financial documents, Reichard said.RELATED: Rob Lorei reinstated as news director at WMNF after appealing firingThe ransomware did infect a new AudioVault system where the station’s audio archives were stored, along with pre-recorded promos played between songs and other audio files. The promos were being recreated on CD, and in the meantime hosts could resort to reading them live.Archived episodes of the station’s news and public affairs programming may be lost permanently.The station has sent the affected server off to a local data recovery company to see what, if anything, can be salvaged.The ransomware also took down the station’s live HD broadcasts. Those signals have instead been broadcasting pre-recorded shows. Those with radios that display what song is playing may have noticed their screens stuck reading "Derek and the Dominos" when tuning in to WMNF since June.Otherwise, listeners would not have heard anything unusual, though the attack has caused small difficulties behind the scenes. The lost files include all of the blank forms the station uses for various office purposes.Reichard was unsure how much money the hackers demanded.“It depends, because you have to tell them which files you want to get back,” she said, but the station ultimately chose not to engage at all.Reichard said investigators told her the ransomware could have originated in Russia.“We don’t really know for sure, other than it came through the AudioVault,” she said. “It could have been sitting in a file for a long time and someone did something that triggered it. Or it could have come in with some music we downloaded.”RELATED: Ransomware attacks put Florida governments on alertShe estimated the situation will cost WMNF $5,000, and possibly more, between the data recovery work and the upgrades to security.Ransomware in recent years has affected individuals, businesses and municipalities. Major cities such as Baltimore and Atlanta fell victim in 2018. In Florida, Riviera Beach and Lake City were so crippled by recent attacks they paid more than $1 million in combined ransom.Public radio stations have been targeted. In 2017, San Francisco NPR station KQED was hobbled for months by an attack that forced one of the nation’s largest public media companies to shut down its entire computer network to prevent the ransomware from spreading.An FBI guidance document says the U.S. government “does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors,” because it could “inadvertently encourage this criminal business model.”Contact Christopher Spata at cspata@tampabay.com or follow @SpataTimes.


Breathalysers could be fitted inside the vehicles of convicted drink- drivers under new government proposals.The Department for Transport is looking into installing so-called “alcolocks” - fitted on all French coaches - onto vehicles to prevent them from starting unless the driver passes an alcohol breath test.In France, convicted drink-drivers can already avoid driving bans if they fit the alcolocks. When fitted, drivers have to first blow into the breathalyser before their engine is able to start. They are then required to blow a second time which is set randomly at between five and 30 minutes later to check that they are still under the limit, with the aim of preventing someone else starting the car for them.Currently, anyone found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in the UK can be imprisoned, banned from driving or face an unlimited fine.The new proposals come amid debates around the new EU rules that require every new car built after May 2022 to be fitted with alcohol detectors as well as anti-speeding devices to alert drivers when they break legal limits.In March, the European Parliament agreed that all new vehicles will need to have an Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) limiter as standard.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: "The UK has some of the safest roads in the world, but we are not complacent and continue to look at how we can make them safer."Today's action plan is a key milestone in our road safety work and sets out the important steps we are taking to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads."Under new DfT plans, drivers caught not wearing a seat belt will also face tougher punishments.Offenders in Britain could be handed penalty points in addition to a fine, meaning some may lose their licence for failing to buckle up.The DfT did not reveal how many points may be given to drivers for not wearing a seat belt, but three points are used in Northern Ireland.Motorists can be disqualified from driving if they build up 12 or more points within three years.It follows new data that revealed more than a quarter (27%) of the 787 car occupants who died in crashes on Britain's roads in 2017 were not wearing a seatbelt.This was compared with 20% during the previous year.Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: "It is barely conceivable that tens of thousands of drivers and passengers make the decision each day not to belt up."The direct effect of non-compliance might be felt by the vehicle occupant themselves in the event of a crash, but ultimately the emergency services are left to deal with the roadside consequences and the taxpayer foots the bills."© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

Foreign minister defends controversial proposal as ‘only solution’ despite misgivings of human rights campaigners
Sarah Marsh

The first Rohingya refugees could be relocated to an island in the next few months under controversial plans drawn up by the Bangladesh government, the country’s foreign minister has said.Some of the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar and are now living in camps in Cox’s Bazar will be relocated to the silt island of Bhasan Char in the estuary of Bangladesh’s Meghna river, accessible only by boat.The proposal has concerned human rights groups and NGOs who are particularly worried about Bhasan Char’s isolation – the island is prone to severe flooding and cyclones and is more than a three hour boat ride from the mainland. Rohingya people living in the camps have repeatedly said they will not go out of fears for their safety.But speaking to the Guardian, foreign minister Shahriar Alam said the plan would go ahead, with the first refugees expected to arrive there within two to three months.“The plan is to give the refugees a better shelter,” Alam said.Despite Bangladesh’s vulnerability to cyclones and rising sea levels, the facilities created on the island – including a cyclone shelter – would help protect refugees, said Alam.“There is a cyclone shelter, and a pond so they can fish,” said the minister. “The only employment option for the Rohingya is fishing.”Pointing to a picture of one of the houses constructed on the island, Alam said: “One journalist asked me why this looks like a jail, but all houses in Bangladesh come with a grid for safety, this is a regular pattern here.“The prime minister, by sheltering the Rohingya, has created a very high moral ground and we would not do anything silly to dent that.”Alam said that, if the first group of refugees were successfully settled, the approach could be replicated across the island, with more people relocated.“I hope in the next two to three months we can start moving people,” he said.Asked what would happen if people didn’t want to go, Alam replied: “We cannot force them to move, of course.”Bhasan Char, 30km from the mainland, only emerged from the river over the past two decades. Concerns have been raised over how much free movement those on the island would have.Over the past year, multiple NGOs have emphasised the difficulty and high risks involved in evacuating hundreds of thousands from the island in the event of natural disaster.Journalists have not yet visited Bhasan Char. Alam said they had to bring over UN bodies first, such as the International Organization for Migration.“We want them to see the place first and we will move them [the refugees] only after that. We are not rushing but we firmly believe this is the only solution,” he said.Alam added that he was not worried about flooding. “A category 10 cyclone will not just impact them [the refugees moved to the island], it will impact 20% of our population … We are vulnerable anyway, so they won’t be any more vulnerable.”


America’s rules on asylum-seeking need to be updated, not erasedIT IS A familiar pattern. The president says something outrageous—this time Donald Trump told four black and brown-skinned Democratic congresswomen, all of whom are US citizens and three of whom were born in America, to “go back” where they came from. His supporters, who have come to accept what many of them previously found unconscionable, stay silent. His opponents, rightly appalled, lament what has happened to their country. At the same time the Trump administration makes a big policy change that attracts far less attention—in this case, an edict that directly affects tens of thousands of people a year and overturns half a century of precedent.Last year 120,000 people claimed asylum, the majority of them at the south-western border. On July 15th the White House announced that claims will no longer be considered unless applicants can prove that they sought asylum in one of the countries they passed through on their way to America, and were rejected. There will be legal challenges to the new rule, because America is party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and because the change may contravene America’s own Refugee Act of 1980. But in the meantime anyone who passes through Guatemala or Mexico on the way to the southern border without first seeking refuge there may be turned away.Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.There is no kind way to enforce immigration law, which by its very existence must squash the dreams of some who wish to migrate (see Americas section). Plenty of asylum-seekers at America’s southern border are not fleeing persecution but crime and poverty. However, this is the wrong way to go about things, for reasons of principle and also of pragmatism.First, principle. The idea that a refugee should be protected, regardless of which countries he might have traipsed through beforehand, is worth defending. It is already dying in Australia and Europe. The European Union outsources much of its asylum policy to Turkey and Libya, for example, or to member states on its fringes; thousands of people languish in crowded camps in Greece. But for America to abandon this norm sends an even more disturbing signal. The land of the free has a proud history of resettling refugees from far-off places, rehousing many more than any other country.Second, pragmatism. Mr Trump has already used threats on trade to persuade Mexico to host more asylum applicants on its side of the border while they await news of their claims. Unable to build his oft-promised wall, his administration has tried to deter migrants by other means, including separating children from their parents at the border. Migration numbers are volatile, and tend to decline in the hot summer months, but so far none of these things has cut the numbers enough for Mr Trump. Clamping down even harder will not alter the incentives to leave El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where most asylum-seekers come from, in search of a better life. It simply makes it more likely that migrants will rely on traffickers rather than the legal system to cross into America.There is a better way. The first step would be to increase the number of judges, to clear the backlog of immigration cases. There are currently not far off a million cases pending; the waiting time to hear them can be as long as three years. Many asylum-seekers disappear into the grey labour market as they wait for their cases to be adjudicated, joining the ranks of America’s 10.5m unlawful migrants; the Department of Justice says almost half do not show up for court hearings. The next step would be to allow the immigration and citizenship service to decide asylum applications at the border. Finally, the federal government could provide more aid to improve conditions in Central America. When Mexico’s economy improved and the fertility rate fell, the number of Mexicans migrating north slowed to a trickle. A different president, with a more expansive view of American greatness, would enforce rules and change incentives, not abrogate rights. ■Join them.

Atlanta: U.S. government officials in 2014 revealed an alarming safety issue: Passenger cellphones and other types of radio signals could pose a crash threat to some models of Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes.More than 1,300 jets registered in the U.S. were equipped with cockpit screens vulnerable to interference from Wi-Fi, mobile phones and even outside frequencies such as weather radar, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which gave airlines until November 2019 to replace the units made by Honeywell International Inc.Today, potentially hundreds of planes worldwide are still flying with the unsafe systems cited in the FAA report. Flight-critical data including airspeed, altitude and navigation could disappear and “result in loss of airplane control at an altitude insufficient for recovery," the FAA said in the safety bulletin, known as an airworthiness directive.Honeywell hasn’t heard of any blanking display screens caused by cell phones or other radio frequencies while an airplane was in flight, spokeswoman Nina Krauss said. When airlines and Honeywell argued that radio signals were unlikely to cause safety problems during flight, though, the FAA countered that it had run tests on in-service planes -- and the jets flunked.Boeing Co. found the interference in a laboratory test in 2012 and hasn’t seen similar issues on other aircraft, a company spokesman said. Honeywell is aware of only one case where all six display units in a 737 cockpit went blank, Krauss said. The cause was a software problem that has been fixed and is currently being flight-tested, she said.The affected 737s are the so-called Next Generation model, a predecessor of the Boeing Max, which was involved in two crashes in less than five months. Cockpit displays on the Max were made by Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., not Honeywell. Boeing’s 777s also were covered by the FAA order.The FAA order didn’t quantify the amount of radio signals needed to cause interference problems. Still, the radio-signal threat extends beyond that specific display system and FAA warning.Numerous cell phones left on during any airplane flight “could be a real problem,' said professor Tim Wilson, department chair for electrical, computer, software and systems engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The greater the number of phones emitting radio signals, he said, the greater the potential for interference with a plane’s flight system.Airplane ModeMany airlines now permit passengers to turn their phones to “airplane mode,' which allows Wi-Fi transmissions. But mobile phones operate at higher power levels, Wilson said, since the signals must reach a cell tower and not just a local antenna or router. “So cellular service is potentially more impactful,' he added.The FAA in 2013 began the process of allowing wider use of electronic devices on planes, provided airlines could demonstrate it was safe. That prompted an outcry from consumer groups concerned about passengers being subjected to the cellphone conversations of seatmates.No U.S. airlines allowed it and, in 2018, Congress barred the use of cellphones for calls during flights.Honeywell initially told the FAA that 10,100 display units -- or the equivalent of almost 1,700 planes -- were affected worldwide. When asked this week about the progress of the fixes, Honeywell’s Krauss said that 8,000 components had been replaced and fewer than 400 needed upgrading.The lower number reflects the fact that some airlines might have had the work performed at non-Honeywell facilities, and regulators in other regions of the world might not have ordered the units replaced. In addition, some planes might have been taken out of service due to age.Depending on how many planes are still in service, the global number flying with display units that could cause critical data to disappear could be in the hundreds. But Krauss said that “even if a blanking incident were to occur,' the units are backed up by multiple redundancies.Both Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have completed their overhauls, according to the companies. American Airlines Group Inc. has 14 more jets that need refurbished units, and United Airlines still needs to replace components across 17 aircraft, representatives from those companies said.Ryanair Holdings Plc, the large Irish-based discount carrier, told the FAA in 2014 that its planes held 707 of the affected Honeywell units and argued at the time that changing out all of them “is imposing a high, and unnecessary, financial burden on operators." A Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline hasn’t upgraded all 707 screens but that the carrier inspected all of its display units and “any affected DUs have been replaced."‘Potentially Disastrous’In just the past three years, mystified pilots flying Boeing NG or 777 jets -- the same models cited in the FAA warning on cellphones -- have reported more than a dozen instances of important flight information disappearing. Calling the situations “critical," the pilots filed their concerns with the Aviation Safety Reporting System, or ASRS, which is administered by NASA.Last September, pilots of a 737-700 noticed that various flight information was flashing on and off, and showing different air speeds and altitudes. Then a primary display unit went blank. “At that time," the pilots wrote, “we decided it was best to get the aircraft on the ground."In January 2017, pilots of a 737 flying out of Costa Rica lost all of their map displays and the flight-management computers on both sides of the plane “during a critical phase of flight in mountainous terrain," according to the crew’s ASRS report. If the flight information had disappeared in bad weather or at night, “it could have been a potentially disastrous outcome," the pilot wrote.Later that year, the captain of a 737-800 reported that key flight data intermittently disappeared as the jet was climbing through turbulence and the screens blanked even more during the descent. After the plane landed, maintenance crews couldn’t find any reason for the blanking display units. “Due to no known cause for a known recurring problem," the pilot reported to ASRS, “I refused the aircraft for the next leg."The NASA-administered database scrubs the reports of identifying details, including names of airlines, pilots and usually the locations. Aviation experts caution that the ASRS filings are based on crew reports and don’t provide official findings. And blanking display screens haven’t been cited in crashes, only in scary incidents.Two years ago, the pilot of a 737-800 reported multiple episodes of important flight information “blanking or simply not functioning," including an incident where the plane flew into a wind shear due to lack of data. “The so-called momentary blanking,' the pilot wrote, “is a puzzle.'This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

As Trump funding drought continues, UN figures show billions more will be needed to meet global target on maternal mortality
Liz Ford

The cost of preventing women from dying in childbirth is projected to increase sixfold by 2030, requiring billions of dollars to achieve global targets, according to the UN.The estimate was released by the UN population fund (UNFPA) on Thursday, offering a snapshot of the scale of the challenge the agency has set itself to end preventable maternal deaths by 2030.Similarly ambitious is a target established by the UN sustainable development goals to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths for every 100,000 live births.Researchers at UNFPA and Johns Hopkins University calculated that the annual cost of direct services, such as paying for medical staff, drugs and supplies when a woman is giving birth, will reach $7.8bn (£6.2bn) by 2030, up from an estimated $1.4bn last year.Donor aid for maternal healthcare fell between 2013 and 2017, from $4.4bn $3.9bn.The projected figure, which takes into account rising population as well as the cost of current interventions and scaling up services, is based on requirements in the countries with the highest number of maternal deaths. It does not include the logistics of getting women to health centres, the barriers they face to access services, or other associated costs.The most recent figures provided by the World Health Organization, which date back to 2015, showed the global maternal mortality ratio to be 216 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The number increased to 436 in the world’s least developed countries. The WHO is expected to update the figures later this year.The UNFPA said the projections, presented in New York, should be a wake-up call for governments. The agency hopes the updated estimate will drive more funding from donors and the private sector.“We want to show the facts to stakeholders that this is the situation,” said Tharanga Godallage, monitoring and data specialist at the UNFPA.“It’s a call to action … We need to accelerate [progress] as we only have 11 years left.”The agency also projected that the annual cost of meeting the growing need for modern forms of contraception would almost double, from $2.3bn in 2018 to $4.5bn by 2030.The UNFPA, working with Johns Hopkins, Victoria University, the University of Washington and global health organisation Avenir Health, will present more detailed cost projections on maternal health, family planning, ending female genital mutilation and child marriage at a November summit in Kenya to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark international conference on population and development held in Cairo. Projections for individual countries will also be produced to encourage governments to increase their health budgets.In 1994, 179 leaders adopted a programme of action that emphasised the centrality of women’s empowerment in tackling population growth and development, as opposed to focusing simply on family planning. More than 200 recommendations were agreed, covering issues such as access to decent reproductive health services, sexual health advice and support, and the elimination of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and forced marriage.The summit in Nairobi will assess the gaps in provision and, the UNFPA hopes, garner political and financial commitments to implement the programme of action and meet the sustainable development goals.The conference comes amid a considerable global backlash against women’s rights, and reproductive rights in particular.Speaking to the Guardian last month, Natalia Kanem, the UNFPA’s executive director, said women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights needed to be “elevated to front and centre” to achieve the SDGs.“We have to respond to the challenge on [women’s] rights,” she said. “While the SDGs are aspirational, they are also a blueprint to what human society needs in order to survive and thrive… full gender equality is of benefit to women certainly, and also a benefit to everybody.”Last Friday, the US government confirmed that, for a third consecutive year, it would not fund the UNFPA under provisions in the Kemp-Karsten amendment. The amendment prohibits foreign aid to any organisation deemed by the US administration to be involved in coercive abortion or forced sterilisation. In a statement on Monday, the UNFPA strongly denied it supported either.The statement said: “UNFPA does not perform, promote or fund abortion, and we accord the highest priority to universal access to voluntary family planning, which helps prevent abortions from occurring.“UNFPA opposes coercive practices, such as forced sterilisation and coerced abortions, and has spoken out against instances of such human rights abuses.”The statement added that the administration had yet to produce evidence to justify the “serious claims made against its work”, and reiterated an invitation for US officials to visit its offices in China.Enacted in 1985, the Kemp-Karsten amendment has been used by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W Bush to stop funding the agency. Funding was resumed under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.The Trump administration used the amendment to defund the agency in April 2017 as one of a number of global policies introduced to restrict global funding for reproductive healthcare.In 2016, the US contributed $69m to the UNFPA to help cover the agency’s core costs and provide short-term support for projects in humanitarian settings. In 2015, the US was the agency’s third largest bilateral donor, contributing $75m to its operations.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.However, it is not biodegradable and instead the crumbly material quickly breaks down into damaging microplastics which easily enter waterways and the ocean where they are consumed by marine creatures.The chemicals used in its production are hazardous to humans and those who are exposed to the styrene component during its production can develop irritation on their skin, eyes, can suffer respiratory and gastrointestinal effects.The same chemicals also diffuse into waterways and seas contaminating the water and many of the animals we eat. Costa Rica has long recognised its unique biodiversity as being among the country’s strongest assets. The country covers just 0.03 per cent of the Earth’s surface, but is home to about 4 per cent of the species on the planet, according to its government. Plastic is recognised as a major threat to this abundance.The government said it will “promote and encourage the reconversion of industries that work in the import and manufacture of containers or packaging made of expanded polystyrene, encouraging the development of more environmentally friendly alternatives.”Costa Rican president Carlos Alvarado Quesada said it was necessary to make a change “in our minds but also in our actions” to protect the natural environment and human health.He said: “Today we have proved to Costa Rica that we will fight to safeguard its fundamental rights, such as the right to health, and at the same time we are sending a clear message that these actions evidence this administration’s compromise to achieve the decarbonisation of our economy.”Haydée Rodríguez, Costa Rica’s Viceminister for Water and Oceans added that expanded polystyrene is one of the largest pollutants of our rivers and oceans, remaining for years in our ecosystems, damaging our wildlife, such as turtles, fish and other animals which think of it as food. She said: “Only with clean and healthy rivers and oceans, we will be able to face the climate crisis and guarantee a healthy quality of life to our coastal communities.”When he took office in 2018, President Alvarado announced a bold plan to ban fossil fuels and become the first fully decarbonised country in the world.At his inauguration speech in May last year, the former journalist, who made his entrance on a hydrogen-fuelled bus, said: “Decarbonisation is the great task of our generation and Costa Rica must be one of the first countries in the world to accomplish it, if not the first.”“We have the titanic and beautiful task of abolishing the use of fossil fuels in our economy to make way for the use of clean and renewable energies.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

If you are on social media you have most likely seen pictures of your friends altered to make them look old and had a chuckle. You might have also seen some people concerned the app behind the photos FaceApp is stealing identities for their Russian parent company Wireless Labs.The app became a viral trend once again with the help of the #FaceAppChallenge. FaceApp currently has over a million downloads from the Google Play Store. Following the app’s success, on Wednesday concerns began spreading on social media that users had given the app too much access to their devices. While the reality of the situation may not be as bad as some of the deeper conspiracies have gone, it still is not all that great.The reason for concern is the terms of service for FaceApp. If you agree to the FaceApp terms of service, you allow the company to do anything they want with your images through a never-ending, irrevocable and royalty-free agreement. This does not necessarily mean the Russian company Wireless Labs is going to do something nefarious with your photo or information. It just means they could if they wanted to.You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed, without compensation to you. When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Services, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your [username], location or profile photo) will be visible to the public.The second reason for concern began once word spread the company behind FaceApp is a Russian company. It is likely this concern is due to the trigger word Russia has become in America due to the long and drawn out “Mueller Report.” What many people do not realize is that FaceApp has existed since 2017 and the app has gone viral before. Yaroslav Goncharov started the app’s parent company Wireless Labs in 2013 in Russia’s St. Petersburg. In 2018, the company moved to Skolkovo. Skolkovo is a city near Moscow often referred to as Russia’s Silicon Valley.According to an interview with Afisha Daily, Goncharov created FaceApp in 2017 during a “junction of two important trends.” In America, Goncharov worked at Microsoft during the day and created his first neural network in the evening about ten years ago. After working on several projects over the years, Goncharov decided to “use this progressive technology for photo processing” and FaceApp was created.FaceApp was born at the junction of two important trends. The first is the ever-growing value of photos and videos. There is an opinion that stories from Snapchat, Instagram and their analogues will soon kill news feeds like Twitter . Facebook is already moving in that direction. The second trend is neural networks. So called the simplified analogue of the human brain, implemented in computer code. To create it, they build a huge network of software simulations of neurons and synapses, capable of analyzing and storing information. Such technologies underlie machine learning, artificial intelligence, cybernetics, and much more. I have been doing this for quite some time now – I trained the first neural network about ten years ago.I worked at  Microsoft in Redmond, USA, and in the evenings I wrote a bot with whom I could play poker. The neural network was only a small, estimated part of this bot – the possibilities to create a solution entirely based on the neural network, then there was not. After that, I worked on several projects related to in-depth training, on a project related to speech analysis. And about a year ago I decided to use this progressive technology for photo processing. This is how FaceApp turned out.At the end of the day, it boils down to your personal feelings on sharing your data. The terms of services are bad but in ways are not much worse than the terms of service for many American companies. As VICE reports, a plethora of American-owned third party weather, horoscope and fitness apps have very similar terms of service agreements. However, there are some significant differences.For one, FaceApp gains access to a user’s entire camera roll instead of requesting access to the pictures you are using on the app. FaceApp will also grab personal information through your “cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and usage data,” then claims to hand the data they retrieve over to “Affiliates,” “Service Providers” and “third-party advertising partners.” According to the privacy policy, this gives “third-party ad networks” the ability to “deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.” In other words, yes, FaceApp is taking your data to possibly hand it over to vaguely defined third-party companies.FaceApp provided TechCrunch with a statement addressing some of the concerns from users. The company claims they only use photos you upload for editing. “We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud,” the statement reads. As of now, security tests have not found the company is uploading images from a camera roll. FaceApp claims they store most images on the cloud for 48 hours to ensure one user is not uploading the same photo repeatedly for different edits. “Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date,” the statement reads.We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority. The company says they do accept requests from users to remove all their data from their servers. However, the company also says their “support team is currently overloaded.” Despite being overwhelmed, FaceApp claims the requests are still a priority. The statement says the features from the app can be used without logging in, which has resulted in 99% of users not using their login. FaceApp claims they do not sell any user data to third parties and the data is not transferred to Russia. The company states again at the end of the statement they only upload images selected by the user and even suggest to check them out with any network sniffing tools available.Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Now new research has indicated they pose a significant risk to plant growth.Usually made of cellulose acetate fibre, a type of bioplastic, cigarette filters can take decades to break down. An estimated 4.5 trillion are littered each year.The presence of cigarette butts in soil reduces the germination success and shoot length of clover by 27 per cent and 28 per cent respectively, and in grass, germination success was reduced by 10 per cent and shoot length by 13 per cent, according to the new study published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. From

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.The research from a team led by academics from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), showed that the root weight was reduced by 57 per cent.But filters from unsmoked cigarettes had almost the same effect on plant growth as used filters, indicating that the damage to plants is caused by the filter itself, even without the additional toxins released from the burning of the tobacco, their report stated. As part of the study, the team sampled locations around the city of Cambridge and found areas with as many as 128 discarded cigarette butts per square metre.Control experiments contained pieces of wood of identical shape and size as the cigarette butts.Lead author Dr Dannielle Green, senior lecturer in biology at ARU, said: “Despite being a common sight littering streets and parks worldwide, our study is the first to show the impact of cigarette butts on plants. We found they had a detrimental effect on the germination success and shoot length of both grass and clover, and reduced the root weight of clover by over half.“Ryegrass and white clover, the two species we tested, are important forage crops for livestock as well as being commonly found in urban green spaces.“These plants support a wealth of biodiversity, even in city parks, and white clover is ecologically important for pollinators and nitrogen fixation.”“Dropping cigarette butts seems to be a socially acceptable form of littering and we need to raise awareness that the filters do not disappear and instead can cause serious damage to the environment,” said Dr Green.Co-author Dr Bas Boots, added: “Although further work is needed, we believe it is the chemical composition of the filter that is causing the damage to plants.“Most are made from cellulose acetate fibres, and added chemicals which make the plastic more flexible, called plasticisers, may also be leaching out and adversely affecting the early stages of plant development.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

A church sign proclaiming, “America: Love or Leave it” in Virginia is drawing almost as much censure as President Trump’s tweets to four Democratic congresswomen earlier this week, telling them to go back to their “home” countries.In the week after Trump unleashed the latest firestorm with the racist series of tweets, Pastor W.W. Lucas of Friendship Baptist Church in Appomattox put up a statement of his own — and is standing by it as both criticism and support rain down.“I thought I was going to make some remarks regarding the situation in Washington,” Lucas told ABC affiliate WSET. “It just came to me... America, I love it. If you don’t love it, leave it.’ ”He and his wife have posted signs, as many churches do, since 1979, according to WSET.Trump on Sunday tweeted that Reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) originated in countries with governments that “are a complete and total catastrophe” and said all four women should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.”All but one of the congresswomen was born in the U.S., and the fourth, Somalia-born Omar, is a U.S. citizen.That didn’t stop Trump from seeming to egg on a chant at a political rally he held Wednesday night in North Carolina as the crowd roared, “Send her back!” in reference to Omar. Trump continued to blast the four minority, progressive women, nicknamed “the Squad.”On Thursday he purported to distance himself and even said he had tried to stop it.But the racism and xenophobia reflected in his remarks was unmistakable.“Tonight I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down,” Trump told the crowd. “They never have anything good to say. That’s why I say, ‘Hey if you don’t like it, let ‘em leave, let ‘em leave.’ ”Lucas’ sign echoed that sentiment.“People that feel hard about our president and want to down the president and down the country and everything, they ought to go over there and live in these other countries for a little while,” Lucas said. He did not specify the countries, or he thought was wrong with them.Many posted favorable comments, such as, “That pretty much sums it up,” as one Twitter user said.But others blasted the message.“There are churches that preach kindness and tolerance,” said the religious blog Patheos.com. “This isn’t one of them.”

            Sen. Bernie Sanders is in the middle as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris face off in the June 27 debate in Miami. Harris and Biden will again share center stage in the July 31 debate.The lineup is now set for the second series of Democratic presidential primary debates, at the end of the month. On the first night, progressive favorites Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be on stage together for the first time, while upstart South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg will be trying to continue his improbable rise. On the second night, the marquee matchup will likely again be former Vice President Joe Biden versus California Sen. Kamala Harris, who had a nasty back-and-forth during their initial debate over Biden's past opposition to busing in some instances. It is also notable that with race playing such a big role not just this past week in politics with President Trump, but also in this Democratic campaign, that all of the candidates of color ended up being on stage together on the second night. That will make for odd optics on Night 1 and also potentially creates a difficult position for Biden, given the exchange over school integration in the first debate.The debates will be held on July 30 and 31 in Detroit from 8 to 10 ET each night. Moderators will be CNN's Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. Candidates for the July 30 debate: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and author Marianne WilliamsonCandidates for the July 31 debate: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and entrepreneur Andrew Yang Loading... NBC News, which hosted the first series of debates last month, also held a random drawing in order to determine the debate stage pairings, but it was held off stage and without much fanfare. CNN, however, hyped the potential face-offs to the highest drama, showing reporters shuffling names and then doing each drawing live (including from an overhead camera). The network did make sure with their lottery that the candidate division would be more equitable, based on polling, across both nights. The network divided the candidates into three buckets and drew participants from each — the four top-tier candidates (Biden, Harris, Sanders and Warren); mid-range hopefuls (Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Yang); and candidates who are mired near the bottom (Bennet, Bullock, de Blasio, Delaney, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Inslee, Ryan and Williamson). In order to make the debate, Democratic hopefuls had to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate had to register at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have reached 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both criteria. Major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just jumped in the contest last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who last week reversed his initial decision to pass on the race, also didn't qualify, given their late announcements. However, the benchmarks will get harder for the next debate in September. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage.The biggest stories and ideas — from politics to pop culture — in 10 minutes.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor


PM says she hopes better paternity leave and time off to care for premature infants will be one of her lasting legacies
Jessica Elgot Chief political correspondent

Thu 18 Jul 2019 17.30 EDT


Last modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 17.32 EDT

Theresa May is throwing down the gauntlet to her successor, pushing for fathers to have more time with their newborns. Writing in the Guardian she says she hopes that better paternity leave and time off work to care for premature infants will be one of her lasting legacies as prime minister.She says the status quo is holding back women and reinforcing the gender pay gap.She writes: “More often than not it is the mother who cuts her hours or opts to works flexibly, the mother who decides not to go for promotion, the mother who stays at home when the child is ill.“Much of the gender pay gap can be traced back to the balance of childcare responsibilities, while the lack of women in senior positions is partly caused by the fact that mothers, much more than fathers, are too often expected to juggle careers with caring.”May says that division is not inevitable but that policy is “not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women 26 times more leave than men”.On Friday the government will launch a consultation on changes to parental leave entitlements, one of May’s last acts as prime minister and which will have to be enacted by her successor.The proposal envisages a longer period of paternity leave as well as a new neonatal leave entitlement for parents of premature and sick babies who need to spend a prolonged period in hospital.May says she believes the choice offered to parents by shared parental leave was gradually starting to shift societal attitudes about who should stay home with a baby, but that the slow uptake makes it clear the government has to go further.“All too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare. So it is clear that we need to do more. The UK has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world, but we only guarantee new dads and same-sex partners a fortnight off work – making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner, and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver.”May says giving fathers longer leave and better pay to spend time with their newborns will not only benefit children but equalise men and women’s roles both at home and in the workplace.“Caring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple starts a family.” She says she was deeply affected by a visit to Alder Hay Children’s hospital when she met parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications, and the fathers were worried they would need to return to work before their newborns got home. “That’s not fair and it’s not right. These are issues close to my heart and I’m proud that today’s consultation – the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that I started long ago – is one of my final acts as prime minister.”


Switch in 2011 led to thousands of cases of heart disease, stroke and cancer, say researchers
Sarah Boseley Health editor

Nearly 10,000 cases of heart disease and stroke and 1,500 cases of cancer could have been avoided in England if the coalition government had not switched to a voluntary deal with the food industry to cut salt in food, say researchers.The Responsibility Deal was introduced in 2011 by Andrew Lansley, then health secretary. The deal asked food and drink manufacturers and supermarkets to volunteer their own pledges to make their popular products healthier, such as by reducing salt and sugar content.Until that time, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) had pushed companies hard to meet specific targets on salt reduction. A paper in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health says that under the FSA, from 2003 to 2010, salt intake levels fell by 0.2g each year for men and by 0.12g for women – from an average of 10.5g for men and 8g for women per day in England.But between 2011 and 2014, annual reductions in dietary salt intake slowed to 0.11g for men and to 0.07g for women.The authors, from Imperial College London, estimate that the slowdown may have led to about 9,900 extra cases of heart disease and stroke, plus 710 associated deaths, between 2011 and 2018. It could also have been responsible for 1,500 additional cases of stomach cancer and 610 associated deaths.If this continued, the researchers said, there would be an estimated 26,000 extra cases of heart disease or stroke and 3,800 additional stomach cancer cases by 2025, affecting the least affluent people in society the most, and adding up to more than £1bn in healthcare and lost productivity costs.Anthony Laverty, of Imperial College’s public health policy evaluation unit, said their paper fitted into the debate over whether industry could, by itself, be depended upon to make products healthier.“I would say, not really. If they haven’t got an incentive to do it, why would they reformulate?” he said.“I would say the lesson both in salt and other nutritional matters is that we need an independent and robust system to say to industry you need to hit these ambitious targets.”The paper, he said, was “another piece of evidence that says relying on these voluntary, loose arrangements with industry really isn’t the way to improve public health”.Graham MacGregor, chair of the campaigning group Action on Salt, and a professor of cardiovascular medicine, said the paper showed that the Responsibility Deal was a disaster for public health.He said: “It slowed down salt reduction in the UK, resulting in thousands of strokes, heart failure and heart attacks every year, particularly in the more socially deprived, many of which could have been prevented.“This reinforces the urgent need for a robust system where we generate worthwhile reductions in salt intake which make a positive and lasting impact.“It is now up to the health minister, Public Health England and the government to set up a coherent strategy where the food industry is instructed what to do, rather than the food industry telling the government what to do, which currently seems to be the case.“The UK currently has no active salt reduction strategy, which is appalling. In fact, the last set of salt reduction targets expired at the end of 2017. It goes without saying we now need to get our salt reduction strategy back on track for the benefit of public health, our overburdened NHS and the economy.”The authors say their study had some limitations. It was an observational modelling study which could not establish cause, and the researchers did not collect long-term data on salt intake in the same people, a factor that could affect the findings.Alun Hughes, professor of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology at UCL, agreed there were limitations but said the study was overall of good quality.“Despite acknowledged limitations, this study casts doubt on the effectiveness of the public health Responsibility Deal in terms of reducing dietary salt intake.“The findings should contribute to thinking about future public health strategies and underlines the importance of careful evaluation of any public health intervention.”

The airline is keen to return the aircraft to service in the autumn.Boeing has said it faces a financial hit over the 737 Max crisis of some $6.6 billion (€5.7 billion), fueling profitability pressures.  The passenger jets have been grounded since March after two crashes that killed 346 people, in which software glitches appeared to have played a role.The airplane manufacturer announced Thursday that its second-quarter earnings for the year would be reduced by $4.9 billion as it compensated airlines for disruptions and plane delivery delays. That figure omits any amounts Boeing may need to pay in the future to compensate families of the victims.Meanwhile, profits would be hit by a further $1.7 billion because of the Max 737's reduced production rate."We remain focused on safely returning the 737 Max to service," said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg."The Max grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognized this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks."Read more: Paris Air Show: Skies darkening for Boeing Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine  Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3LfaZThe aircraft manufacturer is still working on flight-control software to iron out suspected problems.

Since Sunday morning, President Trump has been on an endless tirade suggesting that four Congresswomen – Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib, all women of color – are un-American. Conflating Pressley, Tlaib, and Ocasio-Cortez, all U.S. born citizens, with Omar, a Somali refugee, Trump suggested that all four “go back” to the countries they “originally” came from.In its assumption that black and brown women are immigrants, and that immigrants are less American than citizens, the attack was undeniably connected to the four Congresswomen’s races. As such, it was rooted in those parts of American history that should bring us the most shame.But it was also an assault on the very idea of citizenship itself, in its suggestion that four Americans could possibly belong anywhere else. Though Trump did not suggest he wanted to deport them, the tweets had the whiff of wishful thinking – if only we could be free of these women. Because they are U.S. citizens alone, this wish was a wish for four people to be rendered stateless.For proof that this is what Trump’s supporters heard in his words, we only had to wait for him to repeat the attack at a rally. “They don’t love our country. They are so angry,” he said. “If they don’t like it let them leave.”His audience answered his call with a response: “Send her back.”And while they chanted, the President of the United States smirked.There is nothing more dangerous than the idea that citizenship is mutable, that it can be undone, that it is not a permanent thing. A stateless person has no government who is answerable to them, which means their blood is cheap, if not free. Who will speak up for them when they are inevitably abused? Who will come to their aid?It’s something we Jews know all too well. Before the Nazis began their extermination of six million Jews, they revoked their citizenship. It was a crucial first step, argued the political theorist Hannah Arendt, herself an escapee of a concentration camp. As merely humans, rather than Germans or Poles, the Jews were not only disposable to the Nazis but to the rest of the world.“The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human,” Arendt wrote in Origins of Totalitarianism. “It turned out that the moment human beings lacked their own government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them and no institution was willing to guarantee them.”If you doubt that this could happen today, look no further than India, where four million people, most of them Muslims, have had their citizenship revoked and are being ethnically cleansed. Look to the Rohingya, a stateless minority, whose lack of citizenship in Myanmar was the excuse for their ethnic cleansing (“And where is that exactly?” President Trump asked a Rohingya man today who was requesting help for his people).As Arendt put it, the only true human right is the right to have rights, in other words, the right to be a citizen. And to be a citizen is to be guaranteed citizenship, to be guaranteed rights. That is, after all, what a right is: It is a guarantee from the government of equality before the law and due process if the government exercises state power against you.Trump’s apologists excuse his comments as mere criticism of Omar and the rest of the Squad as they are known. But Trump has allowed his criticism to bleed into calls — both his own and those of his supporters — for the revocation of citizenship. It’s good to see even right wing pundits calling this out.Criticism of Omar and others must remain fair game; she is, after all, an elected official, with a vote on whether the U.S. goes to war. Cries from the left that those of us who have criticized the outspoken Congresswomen have caused Trump’s racist comments are only the inverse of Trump’s belief that there is no difference between criticism and calls for deportation. (The left would also do well to remember the sacredness of citizenship in their comparison of detention centers of non-citizens to concentration camps, which, after all, were used to house denaturalized former citizens prior to their extermination.)But Trump’s suggestion that critics of America are less American, and even worthy of being denaturalized, is an extremely dangerous one. And it’s un-American, too.Batya Ungar-Sargon is the opinion editor of the Forward.Join thousands of readers and give today to help fund the Forward’s reliable reporting, intelligent analysis, and a Jewish voice you can trust on news, culture, lifestyle and opinion.

As of next month, August 1, the so-called burka ban comes into effect in the Netherlands. Those wearing clothing that covers the face in public buildings, hospitals, public transport and schools could face a fine of 150 euros.Clothing which covers the face includes anything from balaclavas to burkas and full-faced helmets. It is specifically clothing which makes somebody unrecognisable, as either the whole face is covered or only the eyes are visible. Wearing such clothing in public spaces like hospitals, schools, public transport or government buildings will result in you first being asked to remove it or leave the location. If necessary, the police may be brought in and a fine will be issued.The fine is set at 150 euros but may be higher is someone refuses to leave the space. The Public Prosecutor’s Office (OM) also points out that the fine can run up if other criminal offences take place, such as violation of the identification requirement.The law, which is officially the “partial ban on face-covering clothing”, is just that: partial. It, therefore, has exceptions. Such clothing is allowed if it is necessary to protect the face and body during sports, for example a mask when fencing, or in a professional context, like a safety mask for a welder.Additionally, clothing which covers the face is allowed in public if a certain event or party calls for it (think masks during a Sinterklaas celebration at school or a bride’s veil during a wedding at city hall). Moreover, the ban does not apply to clients, patients or visitors to long-term care institutions such as retirement homes. This is considered the private domain of clients or patients. For those wondering, headscarves, face paint and caps do not fall under the ban.AuthorMina studied an MA in European Linguistics at the University of Groningen and has since worked as a translator, writer and editor.

                          One of the families in the Ursula center that CBS News toured was Angelina Estrada and her 2-year-old son, Martin
                        On Wednesday night, the world had a first-hand look into America’s largest migrant processing center in McAllen, Texas.CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell along with a TV camera crew (who were allowed in for the first time) toured the center, known as Ursula, which holds more than 815 families, mothers and children — some just infants — in the 77,000-square-foot facility.The migrants slept on mats with Mylar blankets. They were also given warm food and diapers.The conditions that migrants are being held in is at the center of a fierce national debate. Advocates and lawmakers that have toured the facilities at the southern border say they are often dirty and the migrants held inside are sickly and poorly treated.President Donald Trump‘s administration and border officials have argued in response that the volume of migrants from Mexico is a “crisis” that has overwhelmed them. Trump has demanded Congress cede to his policy demands and make the immigration laws more restrictive, which was a key campaign promise, as his critics say his policies toward migrants are cruel and ineffective.One of the families in the Ursula center was Angelina Estrada and her 2-year-old son, Martin. Estrada told O’Donnell they had crossed the border after fleeing from Venezuela, where she had been threatened by the government because of her work as a journalist.RELATED: Mike Pence Defends Unsanitary Border Patrol Station: ‘Care That Every American Would Be Proud Of’“I was in Reynosa almost three months listening to gunshots. It was terrible,” Estrada said, becoming emotional during her interview.When asked if she traveled the whole way with her son, Estrada said she had done it alone.“They left us alone in the jungle,” she said, crying as she recalled the experience and held her son. “I had to walk so much. It was terrible, but I had to do it for my son.”Among the hundreds of adults and children in the facility were 300 unaccompanied kids, sleeping in a makeshift nursery and cared for by members of the U.S. Coast Guard.Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan told O’Donnell he “made the decision to take the risk in bringing cameras in to be transparent about what we’re facing.”“I think we need a national conversation based on the facts that are actually happening on our border to try to address and solve the problems,” he said.RELATED: ‘Zero Humanity’: What to Know About the ‘Cruel’ Migrant Crisis Separating Kids from Their ParentsLast week, Vice President Mike Pence visited the nearby McAllen Border Patrol station for adults where 382 migrant men were crowded together behind chain-linked fences under “sweltering hot” conditions. Given the number of people being held, it would have been impossible for the men to lay down all at once, and no mats or pillows were provided so the men slept on bare concrete.“We prioritize children, obviously. We prioritize families, second. And single adults are the third to get that kind of humanitarian support,” McAleenan told O’Donnell.He said that the “critical issue” behind the conditions inside the centers was a lack of funding from Congress and that a solution to combat the overcrowding would be a “tent city” named Donna. The secretary claimed it would be able to better house incoming migrants.O’Donnell’s coverage continues Thursday (6:30 p.m. ET) on CBS Evening News. CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez  will have an accompanying report on a federal migrant shelter for children in the coming weeks.

If Dutch forces had given the men the chance to stay in their compound, there was just a 10% chance they would not have fallen into the hands of the Serbs, and so the Dutch state should be liable for only that proportion of the damages suffered by the bereaved, the court ruled.The final verdict draws a line under years of legal battles between the Dutch state and the plaintiffs - a group of victims' relatives known as the Mothers of Srebrenica.The case was escalated to the highest court because the state wanted to be cleared of responsibility, while the Mothers of Srebrenica wanted it to be held accountable for all 8,000 deaths in the massacre.An appeals court had previously set the liability at 30%, but the supreme court's ruling has drastically reduced that figure.During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Serb army was engaged in an ethnic-cleansing operation. Thousands of Muslims sought safety in Srebrenica, which the UN was protecting with the Dutch forces. But the lightly armed peacekeepers capitulated during a violent offensive and expelled hundreds of men from the UN base."Dutchbat [the troops] acted unlawfully in the evacuation of 350 men," the court found, according to Reuters news agency. "They took away the chance of the men to stay out of the hands of the Bosnian Serbs."A lower court had previously ruled that the Dutch were liable for the deaths.  In 2017, an appeals court largely upheld the ruling, but reduced the responsibility to 30%.The Mothers of Srebrenica had also originally sought acknowledgement and compensation from the UN as well, but the organisation was ruled to be immune from prosecution.  6-8 July 1995: Bosnian Serb forces start shelling Srebrenica enclave9 July: Bosnian Serbs step up shelling; thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees flee to Srebrenica10 July: Dutch peacekeepers request UN air support after Bosnian Serbs shell Dutch positions.

Environmental groups condemn cutting of company’s fine from £37.7m to £3m
Sandra Laville

Environmental groups are demanding one of Britain’s biggest water companies be made to pay tens of millions of pounds to restore the damage to habitats and wildlife caused by thousands of pollution spills into the rivers and beaches across the south-east of England.As details of the scale of the criminal inquiry into the allegedly deliberate misreporting of data and cover-up of thousands of pollution spills by Southern Water emerge, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are calling on the regulator, Ofwat, to review a penalty of £126m imposed on the company last month.The groups, led by the Angling Trust, have condemned the decision to reduce a fine of £37.7m – as part of the penalty – to just £3m as a lost opportunity. In a letter to the Guardian and in submissions to Ofwat, they are calling for the reduction to be diverted to environmental restoration caused by years of unauthorised pollution spills of raw or partially treated sewage by the privatised water company.Ofwat has put its decision on the penalty it plans to impose on Southern Water, which operates in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, out for a consultation that ends on Friday. In a letter to the Guardian, the Angling Trust and nine other environmental NGOs are calling on Ofwat to redirect the £34.7m reduction in the fine into efforts to restore the environment damaged by the company. Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said it was the environment, not customers, who were the victims of the company’s practices over many years.“If Ofwat is going to reduce the fine Southern Water pays from £37m to £3m, then the difference must be used to compensate the victim: the environment, our rivers and coasts, and the fish and wildlife that call these places home,” said Singleton-White.A criminal investigation by the Environment Agency into thousands of pollution spills into the rivers and beaches across south-east England and a suspected cover-up by senior and middle managers is said by sources to be unprecedented in its scale and nature.Documents submitted to Ofwat reveal that employees at the water company would routinely drive tanker loads of sewage from one waste treatment plant to another to dodge water-quality inspections by Environment Agency officials as part of deliberate manipulation of data to avoid millions of pounds in fines.Southern Water – like other water companies – is allowed to self-report pollution incidents following a change made by the Environment Agency 10 years ago.The company has not revealed where the pollution incidents took place across its region, which includes some of the south coast’s most visited beaches, saying: “For legal reasons it would not be appropriate for us to share that information at this time; however, we will as soon as we’re able to.” But the scale of the multiple leaks of raw and untreated sewage is likely to amount to several thousand spills over many years.In documents submitted to Ofwat, Southern Water said that 991 pollution leak incidents or cases where data was deliberately manipulated could have occurred in 245 out of 300 of its wastewater treatment plants. But in a sample of the three years from 2016-18, there were more than 2,000 pollution leaks from just 10 of the company’s 300 wastewater plants, lasting on average between three and five hours. The vast majority of these involved pollution spills that breached Environment Agency regulations, the documents state.Southern Water has said it is difficult to estimate the impact of historic spills, or determine the severity of the leaks, or their impact on fish and habitats in the waterways. The regulator issued a £37.7m fine against Southern Water in June for failing to deal effectively with the contents of its sewers, “deliberately” misreporting data and allowing pollution spills of partially treated or untreated sewage to run into the environment for thousands of hours from at least 2014, saying some senior employees were aware of the “potentially illegal practices and facilitated those practices.”But Ofwat reduced the fine to £3m because, it said, Southern Water cooperated with its inquiry, and agreed to hand over a rebate of £12 a year to its 4.2 million customers over five years – a total of £123m.Singleton-White said he feared many of the pollution incidents might never be brought to court “due to the obvious lack of data caused by wilful misreporting”.“This only strengthens the case for the imposition of an environmental payment in reparation for damage caused,” he said.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, called water companies to a meeting on Thursday following a damning report on their performance by the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency said: “[We] take this matter extremely seriously. We are pursuing our own criminal investigation into Southern Water due to suspected permit breaches at a number of its sites.”Southern Water said it could not reveal whether disciplinary action had been, or was being taken, against any former or present employee.The company said: “Following a period of ambitious transformation, the business is substantially different and barely resembles the company it was two years ago. A third of senior management have since moved on; the executive team is 60% different and the board is considerably strengthened.”The company said it was cooperating with the Environment Agency investigation.


Former PM doesn’t want wind farms ‘spoiling our landscape’ and praises Angus Taylor for supporting coal-fired power
Amy Remeikis

Last modified on Fri 19 Jul 2019 00.06 EDT

The former prime minister Tony Abbott has continued his crusade against wind turbines, labelling them the “dark satanic mills of the modern era”.Abbott, who was dumped at the 18 May election as the member for Warringah, had previously questioned the health impacts of wind turbines, despite there being no “consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects”. He has also previously dismissed them as “ugly”, “noisy” and “visually awful”.Abbott lost his Sydney seat to the independent MP Zali Steggall, who campaigned on taking action on climate change.Asked by the Sydney radio 2GB host Alan Jones on Friday morning whether his successor had been “sticking them [wind turbines] up there” in his former electorate, Abbott replied there had been “a lot of wind, but not too much action”.“And thank God,” he told Jones. “Because the last thing we want is what I regard as the dark satanic mills of the modern era spoiling our landscape.”“Absolutely,” Jones said. “Absolutely.”Abbott said he was comforted by the energy minister Angus Taylor’s pledge to keep Australia’s coal-fired power stations open.“The great thing about Angus Taylor, Alan, is Angus wants to try and keep our existing coal-fired power stations like Liddell open, because we’ve got more and more wind and solar flooding into the system, and that is great when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, but it doesn’t always blow and it doesn’t always shine, but we still have to be able to flick the switch and have the lights come on,” Abbott said.“That’s why keeping existing coal-fired power in the system is the vital first step in trying to avoid the disaster that will otherwise befall us, the de-industrialise disaster that will otherwise befall us.“This is why the re-election of the Morrison government has been in some respects, I think we have dodged a bullet.”Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningBatteries were not mentioned as part of the conversation, but Jones did remark on “irrelevant” people interjecting into national debates who “exercised a lot of power” in regards to Steggall and the former Greens leader Bob Brown.Abbott did not go into detail about his plans post-parliament in Friday’s interview. As a former prime minister, he automatically receives an annual pension of $296,000, $90,000 more than the backbencher salary he earned in his final years in parliament.Steggall, who won the seat Abbott held for 25 years, has not proposed wind turbines for the Warringah electorate, but was named in some spoof petitions calling for wind farms along Manly beach.Abbott declared in 2015 he wished the Howard government, of which he was a member, had never implemented the Renewable Energy Target. He then signed Australia up to the Paris agreement while prime minister but later campaigned for Australia’s withdrawal when he was returned to the backbench following a leadership coup.

Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHundreds of former members of the Jesus Army are seeking damages for alleged abuse inside the religious sect. Ex-members have told the BBC how children suffered sexual, physical and emotional abuse on a "prolific scale", with most claims relating to incidents in the 1980s and 1990s. The Baptist sect is to close but is the subject of a renewed police inquiry. The Jesus Army has apologised to anyone "who experienced harm in the past" and urged victims to contact police.Ten people from the Jesus Fellowship Church - later known as the Jesus Army - have been convicted for various sex offences.Launched in the manse of a small chapel in Northamptonshire in 1969, the Jesus Army grew quickly in wealth and number. At its peak the JFC had more than 2,000 members, hundreds of whom lived together in close-knit communal houses throughout central England. It offered homeless or vulnerable people and god-fearing families the promise of "new creation" through a devout, all-encompassing way of life. Residents submitted to an intense regime of work and worship. All of their income was given to a common purse and everything was shared - from underwear to parenting.Children could be disciplined by any adult, while youngsters and newcomers were assigned to a male "shepherd" to oversee their spiritual development.  By the age of 12 or 13, children were often separated from their parents. Ex-members say it was typical for adults to enter their bedrooms while they undressed, or watch them take a bath.The BBC has heard that children as young as three who misbehaved could be stripped from the waist, told to bend over and hold their ankles, and beaten with a rod. Community members lived under the unchallenged authority of the movement's creator, Noel Stanton.He was a firebrand who preached daily about sins of the flesh, and cursed wayward members as "backsliders" who were going to hell. Mr Stanton founded the JFC on a huge enterprise of shops, businesses and two large farms, generating millions of pounds in annual turnover. After his death in 2009, the church handed allegations of sexual offences against Stanton and others to Northamptonshire Police. The BBC can now reveal that 43 people who were active in the church have been linked to reports of historic sexual and physical abuse. It is understood further claims have come to light such as rapes, bullying, brainwashing, forced labour, financial bondage and "barbaric beatings" of young boys by groups of men. Detectives have launched a new "comprehensive" inquiry into historic abuse by the church and evidence of a cover-up by five former leaders. However, a survivors' group has raised concerns about the level of compensation being proposed by the church. It is now preparing group legal action involving hundreds of claimants. A spokesman for the JFC insisted a formal redress scheme was being developed "to provide money and counselling" to "those who had suffered poor treatment in the past".It said the scheme had been set up with external stakeholders to ensure everyone was dealt with in a "transparent and even-handed way" "I don't remember ever feeling safe as a child, I think people thought God would protect their children," says Rose, which is not her real name.She is one of a number of alleged victims who have told the BBC about their experiences inside the Jesus Army.Rose was a baby when her family moved to a commune in the 1980s.  She says the intense regime made it a frightening place to grow up, with "loud and scary exorcisms" taking place at every meeting."I remember very strongly as a child a man manifesting next to me, shouting, screaming, retching and being sick on the floor," she says.Fervent sessions of worship were held in the evenings with songs, prayer and speaking in tongues, while most weekends were spent on recruitment drives in towns and cities. Followers donned military-style uniforms and drove rainbow-coloured buses. Rose explained that one of the main teachings was "there is nothing good in you as a person"."Everything in you was the result of sin, and I developed a complete self-loathing because of that message," she says.Rose said children were regularly "disciplined" by adults, including homeless people and drug addicts picked up off the streets."There was something about public discipline... being whacked in front of a whole congregation of people, that was very humiliating." Rose says that when she was 12 years old an older man in her commune began to groom and molest her "every weekend".She says he used to touch her leg under the dinner table or fondle her breasts while handing her money to get an ice cream."At the time, I didn't know what was going on," she says. "I hadn't thought or talked about my body and he used that to molest me and continued to do it every weekend."She knew the situation was "weird and uncomfortable" but felt "he must have had a reason for doing it".When she was 15 years old, she says another prominent figure in the church led her behind a building and forced her to perform a sex act on him."I knew something had happened that was wrong and felt a lot of shame," Rose says, but added that "women were there to serve. We were always subordinate."It was typical for women to be seen as temptresses who corrupted male members, former members said.So when her abuser told the church what had happened, Rose says she was blamed for it. She is now hoping to receive compensation from the church's redress scheme, and is considering going to the police about her alleged abusers.Ben, whose name we have changed, was born into the community in the 1980s.When he was six years old he says he found himself alone in the grounds of his commune with a male worshipper who undressed and sexually assaulted him. "My dad's mum used to say how happy and smiley I was, but [after he was abused] I don't remember anyone ever saying that again," he says. "The memories afterwards are all isolation. I withdrew into myself as a child and I had no friends in particular."Ben became distanced from his family and left the church when he was 17 years old.Recently he discovered his siblings had suffered similar experiences, including one of his brothers who he says was raped during much of his teenage life."I believe that at least five of us have been abused in one way or another," he says. "I have anger for the church. I have anger because of what they did to my family. Whether they chose to ignore it, or give it to God, they're still culpable for letting it happen.""There are still some beautiful people in the church with the best intentions," Ben adds. "But everything's been overshadowed by what happened in the houses."Ben has been speaking to police about pursuing a criminal investigation against his abuser, but says so far there has been little progress.Philippa Muller's family moved from Surrey to the birthplace of the JFC community, New Creation Hall, in Northamptonshire, when she was seven years old.Her father worked in the local tax office and handed over every penny of his earnings to the church's communal purse.Philippa's mother, like most of the other women, was a "servant" and spent her time cooking and cleaning to ensure the men of the house could do their "godly work". Women were encouraged to claim benefits and give them to the church. "I grew up with a very negative imprint as to what it was to be a woman," Philippa says.Young people were urged to recant their sins - real or imagined. They were taught about demonic manifestations and were present during exorcisms.  Philippa became increasingly isolated. "You couldn't just go to have a coffee with someone, or go to the cinema. That was all forbidden."We weren't allowed to socialise. We didn't have TVs. Things were censored... bits from the papers were cut out."One of Philippa's close friends fled the church after she was assaulted by a male elder.Philippa became a key witness in the court case - in which the elder was convicted - but says she was "persecuted" by the church community which treated her as a traitor and liar. She left the church shortly afterwards. Now on the brink of closure, the Jesus Army is understood to have accrued assets worth £50m. But it leaves a harrowing legacy - and an unsettled future for Philippa and its many other victims. Soldiers, teachers and police officers are reportedly getting their biggest rise in six years.'I’d never held hands, kissed or hugged anyone'Sign up for our newsletter


By Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam, CNNUpdated 2345 GMT (0745 HKT) July 18, 2019 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump gave the second-longest speech of his presidency at his rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday night, clocking in at just over 90 minutes.


His racism and intolerance have always been in evidence; only slowly did he begin to understand how to use them to his advantage.The first quotation from Donald Trump ever to appear in The New York Times came on October 16, 1973. Trump was responding to charges filed by the Justice Department alleging racial bias at his family’s real-estate company. “They are absolutely ridiculous,” Trump said of the charges. “We have never discriminated, and we never would.”To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. In the years since then, Trump has assembled a long record of comment on issues involving African Americans as well as Mexicans, Hispanics more broadly, Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, women, and people with disabilities. His statements have been reflected in his behavior—from public acts (placing ads calling for the execution of five young black and Latino men accused of rape, who were later shown to be innocent) to private preferences (“When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” a former employee of Trump’s Castle, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, told a writer for The New Yorker). Trump emerged as a political force owing to his full-throated embrace of “birtherism,” the false charge that the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States. His presidential campaign was fueled by nativist sentiment directed at nonwhite immigrants, and he proposed barring Muslims from entering the country. In 2016, Trump described himself to The Washington Post as “the least racist person that you’ve ever encountered.”Instances of bigotry involving Donald Trump span more than four decades. The Atlantic interviewed a range of people with knowledge of several of those episodes. Their recollections have been edited for concision and clarity.The Justice Department’s 1973 lawsuit against Trump Management Company focused on 39 properties in New York City. The government alleged that employees were directed to tell African American lease applicants that there were no open apartments. Company policy, according to an employee quoted in court documents, was to rent only to “Jews and executives.”The Justice Department frequently used consent decrees to settle discrimination cases, offering redress to plaintiffs while allowing defendants to avoid an admission of guilt. The rationale: Consent decrees achieved speedier results with less public rancor.Nathaniel Jones was the general counsel for the NAACP. He later became a federal judge. John Yinger, an economist specializing in residential discrimination, served at the time as an expert witness in a number of fair-housing cases. Elyse Goldweber, a Justice Department lawyer, brought the first federal suit against Trump Management.Nathaniel Jones: The 1968 Fair Housing Act gave us leverage to go after major developers and landlords. The situation in New York was terrible.John Yinger: Community groups like the Urban League started doing audits and tests to show discrimination. In 1973, the Urban League found a lot of discrimination in some of the properties that Trump Management owned.elyse goldweber: I went to a place called Operation Open City. What they had done was send “testers”—meaning one white couple and one couple of color—to Trump Village, a very large, lower-middle-class housing project in Brooklyn. And of course the white people were treated great, and for the people of color there were no apartments. We subpoenaed all their documents. That’s how we found that a person’s application, if you were a person of color, had a big C on it.Subscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalismThe Department of Justice brings the case and we name Fred Trump, the father, and Donald Trump, the son, and Donald hires Roy Cohn, of Army-McCarthy fame. [Cohn, a Trump mentor, had served as Senator Joe McCarthy’s chief counsel during his investigations of alleged Communists in the government and was accused of pressuring the Army to give preferential treatment to a personal friend.] Cohn turns around and sues us for $100 million. This was my first appearance as a lawyer in court. Cohn spoke for two hours, then the judge ruled from the bench that you can’t sue the government for prosecuting you. The next week we took the depositions. My boss took Fred’s, and I got to take Donald’s. He was exactly the way he is today. He said to me at one point during a coffee break, “You know, you don’t want to live with them either.”Everyone in the world has looked for that deposition. We cannot find it. Trump always acted like he was irritated to be there. He denied everything, and we went on with our case. We had the records with the C, and we had the testers, and you could see that everything was lily-white over there. Ultimately they settled—they signed a consent decree. They had to post all their apartments with the Urban League, advertise in the Amsterdam News, many other things. It was pretty strong.john yinger: Trump had some interesting language after the settlement: He said that it did not require him to accept people on welfare, which was kind of beside the point.Under the terms of the settlement, reached in 1975, the Trumps did not admit to any wrongdoing. But soon, according to the government, they were back at it. In 1978, the Justice Department alleged that Trump Management was in breach of the agreement. The new case dragged on until 1982, when the original consent decree expired and the case was closed. Soon, Trump’s headquarters would be installed in Trump Tower, which opened in February 1983. Barbara Res was the construction manager.barbara res: We met with the architect to go over the elevator-cab interiors at Trump Tower, and there were little dots next to the numbers. Trump asked what the dots were, and the architect said, “It’s braille.” Trump was upset by that. He said, “Get rid of it.” The architect said, “I’m sorry; it’s the law.” This was before the Americans With Disabilities Act, but New York City had a law. Trump’s exact words were: “No blind people are going to live in this building.”elyse goldweber: Was he concerned about injustice? No. Never. This was an annoyance. We were little annoying people, and we wouldn’t go away.barbara res: As far as discrimination, he wouldn’t discriminate against somebody who had $3 million to pay for a three-bedroom apartment. Eventually he had some very unsavory characters there. But if you read John O’Donnell’s book [Trumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump—His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall, written with James Rutherford and published in 1991], Trump talked about how he didn’t want black people handling his money; he wanted the guys with the yarmulkes. He was very much the kind of person who would take people of a religion, like Jews; or a race, like blacks; or a nationality, like Italians, and ascribe to them certain qualities. Blacks were lazy, and Jews were good with money, and Italians were good with their hands—and Germans were clean.nathaniel jones: Consent decrees were an important tool. The sad thing now is that, in his last act as Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum curtailing enforcement programs and consent decrees across the board when it comes to discrimination.The so-called Central Park Five were a group of black and Latino teens who were accused—wrongly—of raping a white woman in Central Park on April 19, 1989. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in all four major New York newspapers to argue that perpetrators of crimes such as this one “should be forced to suffer” and “be executed.” In two trials, in August and December 1990, the youths were convicted of violent offenses including assault, robbery, rape, sodomy, and attempted murder; their sentences ranged from five to 15 years in prison. In 2002, after the discovery of exonerating DNA evidence and the confession by another individual to the crime, the convictions of the Central Park Five were vacated. The men were awarded a settlement of $41 million for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and a racially motivated conspiracy to deprive them of their rights. Trump took to the pages of the New York Daily News, calling the settlement “a disgrace.” During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump would again insist on the guilt of the Central Park Five.Jonathan C. Moore represented four of the Central Park Five when they later sued the City of New York. Yusef Salaam was one of the five young men who were wrongly convicted. Timothy L. O’Brien spent hundreds of hours with Trump while researching his 2005 book, TrumpNation. C. Vernon Mason represented Salaam and other defendants.jonathan c. moore: The Trump ad was calling for the death penalty for juveniles. It was taken out at a time before there was any adjudication of their guilt. The theme was: Here are all these young black kids and Hispanic kids who are going to rape our young white women, so let’s put them all away. You know, we call them the Central Park Five, but it’s really the Central Park 15, or 18, or however many family members there were, because the family members suffered a great deal as well. They visited the boys in prison, on holidays; they did their birthdays inside, had Christmas parties. To this day I talk to some of them and they go into tears when they think about what happened.yusef salaam: When we were accused of raping the Central Park jogger, it really wasn’t an accusation. It wasn’t like we were innocent and had to be proved guilty in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of the people. Everybody, including Donald Trump, rushed to judge us, and therefore it became that much more difficult to be able to mount a really successful fight. And, of course, we lost.timothy l. o’brien: One of the things Trump learned when he injected himself into the Central Park Five case was that he could get attention for himself because he was a spokesman for a certain type of Archie Bunker New Yorker. I think that’s one of the bonds that he shares with [Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor] Rudy Giuliani: They’re both profoundly guys from that moment in New York when a lot of racial boundaries got drawn.c. vernon mason: The level of animosity and hatred was palpable. It was brutal. The language used around this case—“savages”—bordered on the kinds of stuff that Ida B. Wells and others wrote about during the lynching period.yusef salaam: For him to say, You know what? I’m going to take out an ad, and I’m going to call for the state to kill these individuals—it was almost as if he was trying to get the public or somebody from the darkest places in society to come into our homes. Remember, they had published our phone numbers, our names, and our addresses in New York City’s newspapers. So we were pariahs.c. vernon mason: The defendants were afraid for their own safety and for their families. These were not people who had substantial means to protect themselves with security guards, or who were living in some gated community.yusef salaam: I think about when they took our DNA and they tried to match it against what they had. And there was no match, and they still moved forward. The spiked wheels of justice continued to roll down the hill and mow us down. And all of this on the heels of what Donald Trump had published. Donald Trump’s ad was vicious. It was very disrespectful of what the law is supposed to be about.jonathan c. moore: I have children, and I can’t imagine my son being in prison from age 14 to age 21. You’re stealing the most innocent part of somebody’s life. None of these kids had ever had any real interactions with the law before. When they were finally vindicated, there was never any apology from Trump, or even a hint of an apology.yusef salaam: Donald Trump’s ad ran on May 1, 1989. The crime had happened April 19, 1989. We hadn’t even started trial! That was just a few weeks after we were accused. He put nails in our coffin. He’s continuing to do that by continuing to say that we are guilty, by continuing to say that the police department had so much evidence against us. What evidence did they have that stuck? They had no evidence. They had manufactured false confessions.c. vernon mason: In 2016—this is 26 years after the case, and 14 years after it had been proved that none of these defendants had anything to do with that rape—Donald Trump said, I still believe they’re guilty. And I guess, in his mind, he would suggest that they still should be executed.timothy l. o’brien: He trusts his gut on issues surrounding race, because he’s got a simplistic, deterministic, and racist perspective on who people are. I think at his core he has a genetic understanding of what makes people good and bad or successful. And you see it all the time—he talks about people having good genes. He looks at the world that way. He’s got a very Aryan view of people and race.In the early 1990s, Trump attempted to block the building of new casinos in Connecticut and New York that could cut into his casino operations in Atlantic City. (All of Trump’s casinos eventually went into bankruptcy.) In October 1993, Trump appeared before the House Subcommittee on Native American Affairs of the Committee on Natural Resources. The subcommittee was chaired by Bill Richardson, later New Mexico’s governor. Trump was there to support an effort to modify legislation that had given Native American tribes the right to own and operate casinos. George Miller, a Democrat from California and the chair of the Committee on Natural Resources, was also present.Tadd Johnson, of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Bois Forte Band, served as the Democratic counsel on the subcommittee. Rick Hill is a former chair of the National Indian Gaming Association and of the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin. Pat Williams was a member of Congress from Montana. Trump began by noting that he had prepared a “politically correct” statement for the committee, but almost immediately went off script. The hearing became loud and acrimonious.bill richardson: He said he didn’t think that Native Americans deserved the legislation, because there was a lot of corruption around Native American casinos. I remember asking him after the hearing, “Well, what’s the evidence?” He said, “The FBI has it.” I said, “You’re making the accusation; why don’t you bring the evidence?” He said, “No, you should ask the FBI.” I said, “You’re making the charge of corruption and you’re not backing it up—that is unacceptable.”tadd johnson: Trump was wearing pancake makeup, which I hadn’t seen before, at least not on somebody testifying in Congress. He was very evasive, and he made all these allegations about organized-crime activity but could produce no single incident, no tangible evidence, nobody we could talk to. A lot of what he was saying were just fabrications.rick hill: He said, “You guys are all going to have egg on your faces.” This was going to be the worst thing to happen since Al Capone. Trump went all threatening, raving about how there is no way we could stop the Mafia. He used the phrase Joey Killer. He said there was no way the tribal chairmen could stop Joey Killer.bill richardson: The second allegation he made that was very disturbing at that hearing was to examine some Native American tribes’ application as Indian tribes—they were trying to get the subcommittee to basically declare their tribes or their group of individuals Native Americans. Trump mentioned Native Americans who had recently opened casinos and said to George Miller, “They don’t look like Indians to me.” He said that. It was so outrageous.rick hill: Miller challenged him. He said, “You know how racist what you’re saying is? How racist that is to judge people by what we think they look like and ignore their inherent rights as a person?”tadd johnson: George responded, “Well, thank God people don’t have rights based upon your look test. And, you know, how many times have we heard this before in this country?” And then he went through a litany of various groups that were discriminated against, which is a long list.pat williams: I was stunned by the openness of Trump’s anger toward anyone who would compete with him—and particularly if they were people of color.tadd johnson: I remember watching the faces of the Indian people in the back. There were some tribal elders who had come in from Minnesota, and were giving looks that could kill.bill richardson: It was the most hostile hearing that I’ve ever been involved in. And I was in Congress for 15 years.pat williams: I think the reason Trump blew up at Miller didn’t so much have to do with whatever the debate was about at the moment. He blew up because he came to realize that Miller was more important than he was.Later, using a front organization called the New York Institute for Law and Society, Trump and his associate Roger Stone placed advertisements in upstate–New York newspapers in an attempt to block the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe’s planned Sullivan County casino. On a page proof of one ad, featuring hypodermic needles and lines of cocaine, Trump wrote: “Roger, this could be good!” Trump, Stone, and the institute would later pay $250,000 in fines for violating disclosure rules governing political advertising. Bradley Waterman served as general counsel and tax counsel for the Saint Regis Mohawks. Tony Cellini was the town supervisor of Thompson, where the casino was going to be built.bradley waterman: Trump and Stone created an organization that was said to be pro-family and anti-gaming. Its real mission was to put the kibosh on gaming by the Mohawks in the Catskills and in that way protect Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City. To that end, the organization—actually Trump and Stone—purchased ads that portrayed the Mohawks as criminals, drug dealers, etc. The Mohawks regarded the ads as racist. So did I. So did everyone else who weighed in.tony cellini: We were hurting for jobs in this area. And then all of a sudden these attack ads came out, which were financed, we found out later, to the tune of more than $1 million by Donald Trump.bradley waterman: Trump personally approved the ads. For example, he wrote comments on proofs such as “Roger—do it.” Not surprisingly, Trump and Stone lied about the number of people who contributed financially to the organization. It was strictly a Trump-Stone operation. The chiefs were furious, particularly since Trump never met any Mohawks, set foot on Mohawk territory, or otherwise tried to learn about the Mohawks.In the summer of 2005, Donald Trump had an idea: What if the next season of his reality-TV show, The Apprentice, pitted “a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites”? Trump thought the format would be a sort of social commentary—“reflective of our very vicious world.” The concept never made it to air, but Trump’s treatment of black contestants on his show generated controversy.One contestant, Kevin Allen, a graduate of Emory University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Chicago, was criticized by Trump on the show for being too educated; at the same time, Trump suggested that Allen was personally intimidating. Mark Harris was a television critic for Entertainment Weekly. Kwame Jackson was the runner-up on The Apprentice’s first season.mark harris: We were still very early in the history of reality-competition TV. The Apprentice started in January 2004, so the models that I was working off of as a critic were really just Survivor and American Idol. The Apprentice had this very manipulative approach to race. I felt that it was casting and shaping stories toward stereotypes that a default white audience would find somehow satisfying.kevin allen: I remember Donald Trump asking me, “Kevin, why are the women in the suite scared of you?” I had never heard this before from anybody. It was shocking to me to hear that sort of attack. There was a lot of picking at me and trying to make me come out and be that overly aggressive, overbearing, scary African American male. But I was in law school at the time and I had worked on Capitol Hill, and I’m fairly adept at diffusing that sort of thing. I think it made me sort of a boring character. But there were moments when I was put in situations where it could have gone wrong.mark harris: It’s interesting to look back at it now, because the way Kevin Allen was treated was like a sneak preview of white critical reaction to Obama. It was like, Well, maybe he’s too qualified, maybe he’s too smart, maybe he’s too cerebral.kwame jackson: I think that Donald Trump had only been used to dealing with black men of a very specific genre: Mike Tyson, Don King, Herschel Walker—celebrities, entertainers. So to have a young African American man with arguably a better education than him—I don’t think that was something he was used to, because obviously he didn’t hire any in his organization.Randal Pinkett, a black man and the show’s 2005 winner, was asked by Trump to share his title with the white runner-up, Rebecca Jarvis. Pinkett refused. As the winner, he later worked briefly for the Trump Organization.randal pinkett: He did not want to see an African American as the outright and sole winner. I believe I backed him into a corner. It goes back to an old adage that I’ve been told throughout my life as an African American man—that you have to be twice as good just to be considered equal. And that is a statement that reflects the thinking of a Donald Trump. Donald can be racist in ways that he’s not even aware are racist, because he is so out of touch with people who are not like him.timothy l. o’brien: The only people of color he’s gone out of his way to try to establish relationships with are people who are athletes, celebrities, or entertainers. He became close to Mike Tyson because Donald and Don King were trying to arrange heavyweight fights in Atlantic City, to draw high rollers to the casinos. It wasn’t because he was fond of black athletes. It was because black boxers were good for his business.randal pinkett: I was the only person of color that I saw at an executive level in my entire year with the Trump Organization. And to put that into context, this was 2006. This was the height of Donald’s popularity with The Apprentice. He had launched several ventures, most of which are now defunct: Trump University, Trump Institute, Trump Ice, Trump Mortgage, Trump magazine. All of those companies were up and running. All of them had employees; they had CEOs who ran those companies—and still, as I recall, none of them had persons of color in executive roles. None of them.“Our current president came out of nowhere, came out of nowhere … The people who went to school with him—they never saw him; they don’t know who he is.” That statement, made at the February 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference, marked the launch of Donald Trump’s public efforts to sow doubt about whether President Barack Obama had been born in the United States. “Birtherism” had been festering for several years before Trump embraced it—supplanting other proponents and becoming its most prominent advocate. In March, on The View, Trump called on Obama to show his birth certificate. In April, he said that he had dispatched a team of investigators to Hawaii to search for Obama’s birth records.For Trump, the run-up to birtherism had been a controversy that flared when a Manhattan developer proposed building an Islamic cultural center on a site in Lower Manhattan—the so-called Ground Zero mosque. In 2010, on the Late Show, Trump told David Letterman: “I think it’s very insensitive to build it there. I think it’s not appropriate.” Letterman pushed back, saying that blocking an Islamic facility would be akin to declaring “war with Muslims.” Trump answered: “Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.” Trump offered to buy out one of the investors in order to halt the project. The action made him one of the project’s key opponents and for the first time gave him national visibility on the political right. Anti-Muslim sentiment animated Trump’s birtherism campaign. He said of Obama on The Laura Ingraham Show in March 2011: “He doesn’t have a birth certificate, or if he does, there’s something on that certificate that is very bad for him. Now, somebody told me—and I have no idea whether this is bad for him or not, but perhaps it would be—that where it says ‘religion,’ it might have ‘Muslim.’ ” Sam Nunberg became an adviser to Trump after working with him to oppose the Islamic cultural center. Jerome Corsi, the author of Where’s the Birth Certificate?, and Orly Taitz, a dentist and an attorney, are among the instigators of the birther movement. Dan Pfeiffer was the White House communications director.sam nunberg: I don’t believe Donald Trump would have done birtherism if he had not done the Ground Zero mosque and gotten all the conservative publicity he did. I had met Roger Stone, and we briefed Trump on the issue, and he came out and said he wanted to buy the site. Then he got interviews on Fox News. It also was a part of his brand—he wasn’t just somebody coming out saying, “I’m opposed to you,” but “I want to buy it.” He went where the “Just run on lowering taxes” Republican intelligentsia, the Republican establishment, will tell you not to go.jerome corsi: Donald Trump came into it pretty late. I was driving the story well before Donald Trump. He called me maybe three or four times in the period around April and May 2011. Donald Trump’s interest advanced the story in terms of public awareness.orly taitz: I just turned over all the information to him. I talked to his assistant. She told me to forward all the information to his attorney Michael Cohen. Because Trump was a well-known public figure, the issue did get attention.dan pfeiffer: It wasn’t until Trump picked this up that it spilled into the mainstream. It created a permission structure for normal reporters to ask this question. It’s like, Well, Donald Trump, this famous person, said this on The View, which is different than saying Jerome Corsi wrote it in a book.sam nunberg: It was about destroying Obama’s favorability, his likability. It was this way to differentiate Trump from Mitt Romney, who was dancing around not wanting to criticize Obama directly. We looked at Obama as a Manchurian president. Trump will do anything to win. Birtherism would brand Trump as the guy who would do anything he could to take down Obama. He wasn’t just going to lose with a smile and lose respectably the way John McCain and Mitt Romney liked doing.Attempting to quell the conspiracy theories, on April 27, 2011, Obama released his long-form birth certificate. Ben Rhodes was Obama’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.ben rhodes: I remember Obama started to get increasingly frustrated in Oval Office sessions—not just that Trump would say these things, but also that the media would cover it as a story. Obama was angry that he had to release the birth certificate. I remember being in the Oval Office and him commenting that he couldn’t believe he had to do this, but feeling he had to nip it in the bud. Obama was more acutely aware of issues involving race and racism than he sometimes projected. Obama knew this wasn’t going away, and he knew it was racist, and he knew he needed as much armor as he could get.A few days later, at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Obama and the comedian Seth Meyers mocked Trump’s birther claims, leaving Trump red-faced and seething at a table in the audience. Jay Carney was the White House press secretary.seth meyers: We were constantly getting a refreshed list of who was going to be in the room. I will say that we were happy when we saw that Trump was going to be there. I think our best joke about him being a racist that night was: “Donald Trump said recently he has a great relationship with the blacks, but unless the Blacks are a family of white people, I bet he is mistaken.” There’s a thing Donald Trump does better than anybody else, which is that by stating one position, he reveals that he actually holds the opposite position.One of the reasons we piled on with our Trump jokes wasn’t that he was a reality star. It was that he was someone who was doing the rounds, continuing to double down and triple down and quadruple down on this incredibly racist rhetoric. Historically, if you look at other rooms I’ve been in, I’ve never done a run of 10 jokes about anyone before. Obviously we felt pretty strongly for that to be the case.Read: Seth Meyers has ‘very fond’ memories of roasting Trumpjay carney: After that, birtherism diminished as a subject in most media, but I’m sure folks took notice of what Trump had done, and how, by completely concocting this nonsense, he had hijacked the conversation. It still pisses me off.dan pfeiffer: The mainstream political conversation after Obama released his birth certificate was: Trump is a clown, right? He’s a clown who got out of his depth and has embarrassed himself and should be run out of politics forever. It was not long after that that every Republican—even, you know, putatively serious Republicans like Mitt Romney—went and begged Trump for his endorsement. I don’t think any of us realized that there was a tremendous appetite for anger in the Republican base that Trump was seeking to use.Trump did not let up. In May 2012, he told the CNN host Wolf Blitzer that “a lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate.” In August, he called the birth certificate “a fraud.” Finally, in September 2016, under political pressure during his presidential campaign, Trump acknowledged that Obama had in fact been born in the United States. That was not the end of the matter. In November 2017, The New York Times reported that Trump was still privately asserting that Obama’s birth certificate may have been fraudulent.ben rhodes: It cannot be overstated that this is the creation story of Donald Trump becoming president of the United States. His whole brand is: I will say the things that the other guys won’t. Without birtherism there is no Trump presidency.Roughly six months into Trump’s presidency, on the night of Friday, August 11, 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched onto the University of Virginia’s campus in Charlottesville chanting “Jews will not replace us” and “Blood and soil,” a Nazi slogan. The “Unite the Right” rally was protesting the proposed removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Confrontations arose between members of the so-called alt-right and groups of counterprotesters, including members of the anti-fascist movement known as “antifa.”Mike Signer, Charlottesville’s mayor, had been dealing with far-right protests all summer. Richard Spencer was one of the key figures behind the “Unite the Right” rally.mike signer: The first event was in May of 2017, led by Richard Spencer, who invented the term alt-right and is a UVA graduate. He had done an event right after Trump’s inauguration where he had led a fascist salute with all these people at a hotel in Washington, D.C.—buzz cuts, uniforms, very frightening.richard spencer: There is no question that Charlottesville wouldn’t have occurred without Trump. It really was because of his campaign and this new potential for a nationalist candidate who was resonating with the public in a very intense way. The alt-right found something in Trump. He changed the paradigm and made this kind of public presence of the alt-right possible.David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, who participated in the Charlottesville rally, called it a “turning point” for his own movement, which seeks to “fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.” Will Peyton, the rector of St. Paul’s Memorial Church, near the UVA campus, hosted an interfaith service in opposition to the rally. As alt-right protesters marched by, the roughly 700 people in the church were advised to stay inside for their own safety.will peyton: I was out in a parking lot during the morning while all the various neo-Nazi people and different white-supremacist groups were gathering and unloading. They were piling out of vans and trucks, and kind of giddy. I’d never seen swastikas and Nazi salutes out in the open like that—people wearing helmets and carrying clubs and shields.richard spencer: The whole day was chaotic. I woke up that morning; we had breakfast. We didn’t quite know what was going to happen. I certainly thought it was going to be a big event, but I never quite knew that it was going to turn into this ultimately historic event.mike signer: Richard Spencer and David Duke spent time attacking me and talking about the Jewish mayor of the city. There was a threat against a synagogue saying, “It’s time to torch those jewish monsters lets go 3pm.” There was an intensity in the anti-Semitism that previously was unthinkable in American political life. I grew up five blocks from the headquarters of the American Nazi Party, in Arlington, Virginia. It was above what is now a coffee shop, in a ramshackle house, and we laughed at this lonely, pathetic old man who would come in and out of that building. Now you’re seeing something different. I was infuriated that you weren’t seeing a condemnation of this coming from the White House.On August 12, a black man named DeAndre Harris was beaten by at least four white supremacists. At about 1:45 p.m. that day, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old white supremacist from Ohio, drove his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 35 others. Fields was convicted in December 2018 of first-degree murder. In March, he pleaded guilty to 29 of 30 federal hate-crime charges in a separate trial. Speaking on the afternoon of the attack from his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump denounced “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.” He paused, then repeated: “On many sides.” Lisa Woolfork is a UVA professor and an organizer with Black Lives Matter’s Charlottesville chapter. Jason Kessler was an organizer of the rally.richard spencer: We were dealing with this terrible accident that occurred with James Fields and Heather Heyer, and it was certainly not why I came and I don’t think it’s why anyone else came. I was trying to deal with that situation in the best way I could by just saying that we simply don’t know what happened and we should stress that this young man deserves a fair investigation and a fair trial. Trump, in his own way, was being honest and calling it like he saw it. I was proud of him at that moment.mike signer: This was a coordinated invasion of the city by violent right-wing militias. I watched a clip of the president and my mouth fell open, and I was at once ashamed for him and for the country.lisa woolfork: The car sped down Fourth Street and collided with the counterdemonstrators who were marching that way. I was about 100 feet from the impact, and it was complete chaos. I remember seeing a shoe fly into the air. I remember people screaming. It was an utterly terrible moment. After a long and traumatic day, the president’s remarks were chilling. One of the dangers of having the president speak in the way that he spoke about the events in Charlottesville—about “many sides”—was that it promotes this very dangerous false equivalency. Trump made things much worse by explicitly stating that you can be a white supremacist or a Nazi or a neo-Confederate and still be a good person.jason kessler: The president was absolutely correct in blaming both sides. I’ve probably seen more video of the event than anyone alive. People who are upset feel that the majority of the blame should be with the alt-right because of the tragic death of Heather Heyer. It’s fair enough to acknowledge their emotional need for this, but no one at “Unite the Right” was responsible for that car accident but James Fields himself.will peyton: I had a visceral, emotional reaction when I heard what the president said. I was an eyewitness. I saw with my own eyes that there was one side here that came planning and intending violence. There’s just no two ways about that.On August 14, Trump walked back his initial statement and specifically condemned “the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.” A day later, he walked back his walk-back. There were “very fine people on both sides,” he said, adding that the “alt-left” had been “very, very violent.” White-nationalist leaders welcomed his remarks.mike signer: There was a robocall that went out in November 2018, because the trial of Alex Fields was happening and he was about to be convicted. The call was all about how the Jew mayor and the Negro police chief had created this situation, and how we’re the ones who should be held responsible for Heather Heyer’s death.In office, Donald Trump followed through on his promise to curb immigration from majority-Muslim countries. He created a commission to investigate voter fraud (virtually nonexistent, according to state election officials), claiming that he would have won the popular vote but for millions of ballots cast by people in the U.S. illegally. He shut down the government for 35 days in an attempt to secure funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He reportedly referred to African countries as “shithole” nations—asking why the U.S. can’t have more immigrants from Norway instead—and complained that, after seeing America, immigrants from Nigeria would never “go back to their huts.” The administration favored victims of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston, over those of Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico, sending three times as many workers to Houston and approving 23 times as much money for individual assistance within the first nine days after each hurricane.sam nunberg: Remember in 2011 he was criticized when he said, “I’ve always had a great relationship with the blacks”? I think he just doesn’t speak “politically correct.” It’s not in his vernacular, or consciousness. It’s generational. It’s also probably—not to play psychiatrist—it’s growing up where he grew up, in Queens, New York, and dealing with union members, dealing in a crime-riddled New York City. I think it’s just the way things were thought of as different then.timothy l. o’brien: This is the same debate we have about whether or not he’s a liar. And I get the journalistic need to be really clear about how we use terms. You know, lying implies volition and knowledge. But I’m very comfortable saying I think he’s got a pathology around lying. And when it comes to race, I don’t think it’s merely using racial animosities or race-baiting as tools to promote his business. I think it’s a deep-seated reflection of what he thinks about how the world works.kwame jackson: America’s always trying to find this gotcha moment that shows Donald Trump is racist—you know, let’s find this one big thing. Let’s look for that one time when he burned a cross in someone’s yard so we can now finally say it. People refuse to see the bread crumbs that are already in front of you, leading you to grandma’s house.This article appears in the June 2019 print edition with the headline “An Oral History of Trump’s Bigotry.”
    A man is tormented by a low-frequency humming sound emanating from his house, which he believes is caused by a nearby gas pipeline.
If multiracial democracy cannot be defended in America, it will not be defended elsewhere.The conservative intelligentsia flocked to the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C., this week for the National Conservatism Conference, an opportunity for people who may never have punched a time clock to declare their eternal enmity toward elites and to attempt to offer contemporary conservative nationalism the intellectual framework that has so far proved elusive.Yoram Hazony, the Israeli scholar who organized the conference, explicitly rejected white nationalism, barring several well-known adherents from attending, my colleague Emma Green reported. But despite Hazony’s efforts, the insistence that “nationalism” is, at its core, about defending borders, eschewing military interventions, and promoting a shared American identity did not prevent attendees from explicitly declaring that American laws should favor white immigrants.America’s urban rebirth is missing something key—actual births.A few years ago, I lived in a walkup apartment in the East Village of New York. Every so often descending the stairway, I would catch a glimpse of a particular family with young children in its Sisyphean attempts to reach the fourth floor. The mom would fold the stroller to the size of a boogie board, then drag it behind her with her right hand, while cradling the younger and typically crying child in the crook of her left arm. Meanwhile, she would shout hygiene instructions in the direction of the older child, who would slap both hands against every other grimy step to use her little arms as leverage, like an adult negotiating the bolder steps of Machu Picchu. It looked like hell—or, as I once suggested to a roommate, a carefully staged public service announcement against family formation.Personal-finance gurus really hate coffee.Suze Orman wants young people to stop “peeing” away millions of dollars on coffee. Last month, the personal-finance celebrity ignited a controversy on social media when a video she starred in for CNBC targeted a familiar villain: kids these days and their silly $5 lattes. Because brewing coffee at home is less expensive, Orman argued, purchasing it elsewhere is tantamount to flushing money away, which makes it a worthy symbol of Millennials’ squandered resources.Orman’s not alone in this view. The old guard of personal finance has spent years turning the habit of buying coffee into a shorthand for Americans’ profligacy, especially that of young Americans. Dave Ramsey, a finance personality who hosts a popular radio show on getting out of debt, says that forgoing lattes is one of four keys to saving thousands of dollars. Kevin O’Leary, one of the investors on the entrepreneurial reality show Shark Tank, once told CNBC, “I never buy a frape-latte-blah-blah-blah-woof-woof-woof.” Even the official Twitter account for Chase Bank has gotten in on the fun, intimating via meme that a failure to brew at home is why young people don’t have any money.Amid a convulsive week in American politics, at one of the darkest rallies Donald Trump has ever held, his base showed up in force to tell the president he’s done nothing wrong.GREENVILLE, N.C.—Before the rally began, I wanted to know why they’d come.In the heavy, humid hours, I walked up and down the line winding through a parking lot at East Carolina University to interview some two dozen people who wanted to see the president. Many didn’t make it inside. About 90 minutes before Donald Trump took the stage, police announced that the 8,000-person basketball arena was full and those still waiting would have to watch on an oversize TV monitor set up outside. Rather than head home, they stuck around for a tailgate party of sorts.Some cracked open beers and lit cigars, sitting on folding chairs in front of the TV. People walked by in shirts that read In Trump We Trust and Fuck Off, We’re Full. Earlier, in the 100-degree heat, a four-member family band called the Terry Train entertained the crowd with a song mocking CNN. Lying Wolf Blitzer and Lying John King. Don Lemon lies about everything … Erin Burnett, can you hear us yet? We’ll give you a story you can never forget. It built to this refrain: CNN sucks!Four legs good, two legs completely bonkersEarlier today, the fabric of the space-time continuum stretched and rearranged itself. The Cats trailer dropped. It prompted a handful of questions.1. There are cobbles on the street. Is this Victorian London? There’s also a lot of neon. Is this Vegas? There’s also a person on all fours arching her back like a cat, even though she’s obviously human. But she has a tail. I don’t know.2. She just turned around and, holy god, she has a human face, cat ears, a white leotard the texture of coir matting, and a forehead like Krang from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. What is she? Am I high? Is she high? Is this the final glitch in The Matrix that ushers in end times?3. This sounds like Jennifer Hudson singing “Memory.” No one should sing “Memory” apart from maybe Maude Apatow. There’s a neon sign in the background advertising a “Milk Bar,” which means we’re fully committed to the idea that these monstrosities are cats. Either that, or this is a trippier remake of A Clockwork Orange. A man in an extravagant hat just slipped through an iron gate, so I’m sensing the latter.The Korean supergroup’s devoted following and chart-topping success have won them comparisons to the Beatles. Why was I surprised to get swept up in their magic?I was already yawning when I sat down to watch Saturday Night Live one evening this past April. The host that night was Emma Stone, and the musical guest was BTS. I knew little about the seven-member South Korean supergroup—even though they had millions of fans worldwide, released multiple Billboard 200 chart-toppers, and recently delivered a speech at the United Nations. On Twitter, I saw plenty of enthusiasm, but also mockery directed at BTS and their followers. While I knew they would be the first K-pop act to perform on SNL, I had never listened to a BTS song before Stone introduced the first musical break.The oh whoa ooh whoa backing vocals floated in, and a teasing bass line began as the lights went up to reveal seven figures—their backs to the camera—in dark suits and an array of hair colors. They swayed from side to side and spun around. Then the one with the pink hair started singing.Her silence on the border crisis and on her father’s racist tweets shows she has abandoned even the pretense of being a voice of reason inside the White House.Ivanka Trump wants it both ways.Since joining her father’s White House as a senior adviser in early 2017, the first daughter has reserved the right to toggle between a strict and loose construction of her portfolio. When flashy opportunities arise—such as the chance to play diplomat with Kim Jong Un—the edges of her purview, which she often defines as “women’s economic empowerment,” become conveniently blurry. But when the issue du jour is particularly messy, she is quick to clarify its limits, thus absolving herself of accountability for problems that exist outside it. When The View’s Abby Huntsman, for example, asked Trump in February why she didn’t speak up about family separations along the U.S.-Mexico border, she objected that she is “not president of all women’s issues.”The president needs the voters who approve of his record on the economy but disapprove of him overall. His racist attacks this week only hurt that cause.Buried beneath the blustery bravado of Donald Trump’s openly racist attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color were clear signs of electoral anxiety.Trump insists he is producing great results for the country, especially on the economy. And yet, at the price of provoking great backlash, he moved in an unprecedented manner this week to portray four non-white Democratic representatives as fundamentally un-American, not only ideologically but also racially and ethnically.In so doing, Trump has telegraphed that, ahead of 2020, he hopes to focus at least as much on the jagged divide of “Who is a real American?” as on the traditional question incumbent presidents seeking reelection highlight during generally good economic times: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”What new research reveals about sexual predators, and why police fail to catch themRobert Spada walked into the decrepit warehouse in Detroit and surveyed the chaos: Thousands of cardboard boxes and large plastic bags were piled haphazardly throughout the cavernous space. The air inside was hot and musty. Spada, an assistant prosecutor, saw that some of the windows were open, others broken, exposing the room to the summer heat. Above the boxes, birds glided in slow, swooping circles.It was August 17, 2009, and this brick fortress of a building housed evidence that had been collected by the Detroit Police Department. Spada’s visit had been prompted by a question: Why were police sometimes unable to locate crucial evidence? The answer lay in the disarray before him.No one has done more to dispel the myth of social mobility than Raj Chetty. But he has a plan to make equality of opportunity a reality.Raj Chetty got his biggest break before his life began.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the pack of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren tied behind him, according to a new NBC News|SurveyMonkey online poll.The poll, conducted after the first Democratic debate in late June, shows 25 percent of respondents would vote for Biden if a primary or caucus was held today, while Sanders, I-Vt., and Warren of Massachusetts each garnered 16 percent.Sen. Kamala Harris of California was close behind, with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter Buttigieg registered at 8 percent. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey each snared 3 percent, while the rest of the 24 person field came in at 2 percent or less.The poll was conducted between July 2 and July 16, after 20 of the Democratic candidates went head-to-head in the first primary debate in Miami, which was hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo over two nights.The survey also found that President Donald Trump's overall approval rating ticked upward to 48 percent in July, compared to 45 percent in a NBC News|SurveyMonkey online poll in September. The president's disapproval rating decreased to 51 percent, compared to 54 percent in the September poll.The survey also shows the Trump administration's frequent messaging about a crisis on the border appears to be impacting public opinion.A total of 22 percent of respondents said immigration is the issue that matters the most to them right now, up from 15 percent in September. That was slightly more than the number of people who identified health care or jobs as the most important issue — both garnered 21 percent. Fourteen percent said the environment was their top concern.In September, 25 percent of respondents had identified jobs and the economy as the most important issue. The new poll found 68 percent of Americans said the condition of the national economy is "very good" or "fairly good," down 1 percentage point from September.The poll found most Americans don't like Congress: Seventy-five percent of respondents "somewhat disapprove" or "strongly disapprove" of the way Congress is handling its job. That number was up a tick from 74 percent in September. Only 24 percent of respondents approved of the job the body is doing, about even with the September poll.A majority of Americans are also in favor of keeping abortion legalized. Asked if they would "like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe v. Wade decision," 64 percent of respondents said no.A small majority were also in favor of paying higher taxes to improve schools and infrastructure in their states. Fifty-four percent said they'd be "very willing" or "somewhat willing" to pay higher taxes to improve public schools, while 59 percent said they'd be very or somewhat willing to pay higher taxes to fund improvements to roads and bridges.The NBC News|SurveyMonkey national poll was conducted July 2-16 among 13,553 registered voters with an error estimate of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points. Among the 5,548 Democrat and Democratic-leaning registered voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

 Iran laughed off Donald Trump's assertion the US shot down an Iranian drone on Thursday, saying they're "worried" the US actually torpedoed one of their own.  "We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else," Iran deputy foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi  tweeted early on Friday.  "I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!"  On Thursday, President Trump said  USS Boxer destroyed an Iranian drone which had come within "threatening" range, of the amphibious assault ship, as it sailed through  the Strait of Hormuz. "At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz," Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman  told Business Insider's Ellen Ioanes. Read more: Iranian gunboats backed away in a showdown with a Royal Navy frigate after staring down the barrel of the 'perfect weapon' "A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew," he added.  The Pentagon did not immediately say how the drone was destroyed, but  CNN cited a US defense official as saying the ship had used electronic jamming to down it.  Tensions in the Persian Gulf have intensified since  Iran said it would breach its limit on low-enriched uranium, disregarding promises it made under the  2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).                                                                                 Read more: The UK is deploying another warship to the Persian Gulf as concern grows over a tanker that went missing near Iran The US pulled out of the JCPOA in May 2018, and relations between the two states have become increasingly frosty since then. Tensions have heightened in recent weeks after a series of skirmishes at sea in the waters around Iran.  On June 13, Japanese and Norwegian oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. Iran swiftly denied responsibility.  A video  released by the US military the next day purported to show Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps' boats taking an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of the Japanese tanker.                                                                                  On June 20,  Iran shot down a US Navy RQ-4 Global Hawk drone. Trump quickly called the clash "a mistake" to ease tensions in the Gulf.  Tensions between Tehran and the West heightened further when the UK seized an Iranian ship sailing through the Strait of Gibraltar, claiming it was illegally transporting oil to Syria.  Iran then responded by ordering all "foreign powers" to  leave the Strait of Hormuz, saying the West was playing a "dangerous game"  The US has sent thousands of additional troops and fighter jets to the region amid the mounting tensions. 


Is their moral courage totally AWOL?Republicans must think “crooked Donald” is invincible. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)In 1956, then Senator John F. Kennedy authored a best-selling book titled Profiles in Courage, in which he told the stories of Senators in American history who, on principle, bucked the tides of power. Today, some Republican writer or conservative syndicated columnist – George Will or Max Boot – should write a book called Profiles in Cowardliness. It should cover Republican leadership’s near total cowardliness in the face of Donald Trump, whom they despise on many fronts. Many in Republican leadership believe he has hijacked their Grand Old Party (GOP).Clearly the Republicans – except for Rep. Justin Amash, who recently quit the Party after accusing Trump of impeachable crimes – are intimidated by this foul-mouthed president. Republican politicians are cowed by Trump’s bellicose personal rhetoric. We have seen this cycle repeat itself countless times, with the media boosting their ratings by recklessly repeating Trump’s insults.Republicans remember what Trump did to Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican primary. They observe how loud-mouthed Donald spews toxic falsehoods at Democrats and gets away with it. Why, Republicans ask themselves, should they take any chances provoking this unstable Twitter Emperor and his ditto-heads on social media whom he deliberately incites? The answer: because patriotism demands action.Donald Trump acts as if he is above the law – coming off his career as a corporate criminal, he has become a government outlaw. He has always cheated justice. Trump flouts the Constitution, refuses to faithfully execute the laws preventing corporate crimes, and obstructs justice.  Just as bad are Trump’s ethical and personal failings; he has brought disgraceful personal behavior, serious daily lies, expensive nepotism, denials of grave realities facing the country, bigotry, violent incitement, and disrepute to the White House. All of these failings are why the Founding Fathers gave impeachment authority to the House of Representatives and the authority of open trial to the Senate.There are many more indictable and impeachable offenses, but the focus here is on why the entire GOP has completely fallen in line.  Only former Republican Governor of Massachusetts William Weld has dared to officially challenge Trump in the upcoming Republican primary.  This week, former Republican Congressman and Governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford announced he is testing the waters for a run against President Trump, emphasizing Trump’s huge expanding deficits. It is shocking that so few opponents have emerged considering Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 and remains more consistently unfavorable in the polls than any president in modern times.Republicans must think “crooked Donald” is invincible. So why try? Plenty of Republican politicians consider Trump to be a clear and present danger to Party and country. They include Former Senators Flake and Corker; current Senator Mitt Romney; former Governor of Ohio John Kasich; former New Jersey Governor and EPA head, under Reagan, Christine Todd Whitman; and former House Speaker Paul Ryan. All have spoken out about Trump’s dangerous ignorance and loutishness. All believe him to be unqualified and fear his reckless actions. On trade, immigration, climate crisis, and his open admiration of brutal dictators, they find him appalling.Yet there are few signs of a serious challenge. In the 1990s, John Kasich was the Chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee. At the time he was critical of the wasteful, unauditable Pentagon budget then (imagine now). Asked about 2020, Kasich told The Washington Post that he’s “never gotten involved in a race that [he] didn’t think [he] could win,” adding, “things are very volatile in this business and you just cannot predict what might change.” Such words hardly signal anything beyond extreme caution.One would think, these persons and others who could take on Trump (for example, the very popular former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean) would want to stand up for traditional Republican principles and positions (think about Senator Robert Taft, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Theodore Roosevelt, and of course, Abraham Lincoln). In sharp contrast, current Republican leaders almost never criticize Trump publically apart from a mild op-ed (Romney) or the occasional public comments (Whitman).It gets worse. Apart from William Kristol, Trump’s arch-critic, there doesn’t seem to be any activity among Republican kingmakers to find a challenger or even consider mounting a third party accountability challenge from the political right.There is someone, were he younger, who would take on Trump. He is former Republican Senator from Connecticut, Lowell Weicker. He was known in the Senate as a ferocious defender of the Constitution and was prominent during the Watergate hearings that exposed Richard Nixon.Apart from elected officials, what about those cabinet secretaries and White House chief of staff, whom Trump praised to the skies, before he drove them out with a frenzy of ruthless epithets (“dumb as a rock,” etc.)? They know the insides of mad Trump’s White House, which would receive media attention.At the least, Republicans who challenged Trump in the primaries would put Trump on the defensive and hold him more accountable.Time is passing on the road to November 2020. There are countless Republicans who deeply believe that Trump is a disgrace to his office and a threat to the Republic, as well as to the future of the Republican Party. Who amongst them will stand up and be counted?Is their moral courage totally AWOL?Because of people like you, another world is possible.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee who will question former special counsel Robert Mueller next week plan to focus on a narrow set of episodes laid out in his report, an effort to direct Americans’ attention to what they see as the most egregious examples of President Donald Trump’s conduct.The examples from the Mueller report include Trump’s directions to White House counsel Donald McGahn to have Mueller removed and, later, orders from Trump to McGahn to deny that happened. Democrats also will focus questioning on a series of meetings Trump had with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in which the Republican president directed Lewandowski to persuade then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller’s investigation.Mueller laid out several episodes in which Trump tried to influence his investigation and wrote that he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.Democratic aides say they believe the McGahn and Lewandowski narratives, explained in detail in the 448-page report, are clear examples of such obstruction and will be easy to understand as lawmakers try to educate the American public on a report that they believe most people haven’t read. The aides requested anonymity to freely discuss members’ plans for questioning.The House Judiciary and intelligence committees will question Mueller in back-to-back hearings July 24. The testimony had been scheduled for July 17 but was delayed . Time will be extremely limited under an agreement with Mueller, who is a reluctant witness and has said he will stick to the contents of the report.To effectively highlight what they see as the most damaging parts of the report, lawmakers said Thursday that they will have to do something that members of Congress aren’t used to doing: limit the long speeches and cut to the chase.“Members just need to focus,” said Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democratic member of the intelligence panel. “Nobody’s watching them. Keep it short, keep focused, listen to each other, work together. Make this as productive as possible.”Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said: “You will find little or no editorializing or speechifying by the members. This is all about allowing special counsel Mueller to speak.”Lawmakers on the Judiciary panel said that they have been working with committee staff on which members will ask what. The staff wants to make sure that they ask targeted questions, such as on Trump’s directions to McGahn and Lewandowski.“It’s going to be fairly scripted,” said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, another Democrat on the Judiciary panel. “The main goal is to get Robert Mueller to say what Robert Mueller wrote in the Mueller report. And then get it on national TV, so people can hear him saying it.”The Judiciary Committee aides said that they want lawmakers to take multiple pieces of information in Mueller’s report and connect the dots for viewers. Besides the episodes with McGahn and Lewandowski, they said lawmakers also will focus on the president’s conduct toward his former lawyer Michael Cohen and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. The report looks at how Trump praised both men when he perceived they were on his side, contacting Cohen to tell him to “stay strong” and publicly praising Manafort for “refusing to break.” There also were subtle hints that he could pardon each.Cohen eventually started cooperating with the government, and Trump then publicly called him a “rat” and suggested his family members had committed crimes.The House intelligence panel, which has fewer members, is expected to focus on the first volume of Mueller’s report, which details multiple contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Mueller found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between the two.House intelligence committee aides, who also declined to be identified to discuss the confidential preparations, said that lawmakers on that panel are expected to focus on those contacts and on what the report says about WikiLeaks, the website that released Democratic emails stolen by the Russians.As the Democrats methodically work through the highlights of the report, it could start to feel a bit like a class: Mueller 101.Raskin, a longtime constitutional law professor, says he plans to use some visual aids, like posters, to help people better understand what Mueller wrote.“We have different kinds of learners out there,” Raskin said. “And we want people to learn, both in an auditory way but also in a visual way, about these dramatic events that Mueller will be discussing.”Republicans are preparing as well and are expected to focus more on Mueller’s conclusions — that there isn’t enough evidence of a conspiracy and no charges on obstruction — than the individual episodes detailed. The top Republican on the Judiciary panel, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, said his members will be asking questions that aim to confirm what is in the report.But while the Democrats are eagerly anticipating the opportunity, many of the Republicans are weary.“Frankly the American people have moved on,” Collins said. They “want to get it behind us.”


Truthdig newsletterFollow usIn the runup to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has released her vision for tackling college debt, reducing the cost of child care and reforming immigration, but her latest plan involves the issue that first brought her to national prominence: Wall Street.In a post published Thursday on Medium, Warren calls for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law separating commercial banks from their investment divisions, thereby preventing banks from using consumer deposits for risky investments.The law was partially repealed in 1999, which, as a 2015 NPR analysis explained, “opened the floodgates for giant mergers” and allowed commercial banks to engage in such previously banned activities as investments and insurance.Warren calls her latest proposal part of her “economic patriotism agenda,” which, in addition to reinstating Glass-Steagall, includes plans for postal banking and reining in executive compensation by tying pay to companies’ performance, and new rules for private equity firms, which make money by buying failing companies, restructuring (often by cutting budgets and laying off workers), and then reselling the companies for a profit.“Sometimes the companies do well,” Warren notes. “But far too often, the private equity firms are like vampires—bleeding the company dry and walking away enriched even as the company succumbs.”CNN called Warren’s new proposal “red meat for the Democratic Party’s liberal base, which has zeroed in on Wall Street speculation as a root cause of growing economic inequality.”But Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the American Investment Council, a group representing the private equity industry, sees the proposal as harmful. “Extreme political plans only hurt workers, investment, and our economy,” he told CNN, adding that “[p]rivate equity is an engine for American growth and innovation—especially in Senator Warren’s home state of Massachusetts.”Warren has long championed constraining Wall Street. “In the lead-up to the 2008 crisis,” even before she was a senator, she writes, “I rang the alarm bell as I saw the same tricks and traps emerging in mortgages.”She continues: “And after I proposed a new federal agency to protect consumers—and President Obama signed that agency into law in 2010—I spent nearly a year setting up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping write new rules to crack down on financial scams.”During the last Democratic presidential primary, Warren pushed candidates to include a repeal of Glass-Steagall in their policy platforms. As CNN reported at the time, in a 2015 email, she warned supporters, “Wall Street spent decades—and millions of dollars—to repeal the original Glass-Steagall Act, and you can bet they’ll do whatever it takes to keep it from being reinstated. … We need grassroots support from all across the country if we’re going to fight back to make our financial institutions smaller and safer.”Read Warren’s latest proposal here.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.“You kissed me on the lips in front of the paparazzi, and I said: “That’ll cost you, I’m booking you on the show,” the talk show host said.Mr Trump interrupts her to tell the audience: “And what a kiss … [the kiss] was so good, so open and nice. She’s a fabulous woman.”He added: “Her husband is a handsome devil, I’ll tell you. He’s a good guy. But I think he had his back turned at the time.”When the newly-divorced star was asked who he would like to date next, Mr Trump initially said Princess Diana, before adding: “I think my choice might be you. Look at the legs on her. Boy.”He also said: “I love women … I prefer a beautiful woman to a non-beautiful woman.”Earlier this week NBC shared a shorter clip showing Mr Trump and Epstein laughing and watching women dance – only days after the president denied he was friends with the billionaire arrested on a series of child sex trafficking charges earlier this month. Mr Trump is seen to lean towards Epstein and apparently say: “Look at her, back there … She’s hot.”The party was reportedly part of 36 hours of footage captured by A Closer Look after Mr Trump agreed to let the NBC team film him at work and play.Ex-hedge fund manager Epstein faces accusations that he sought children as young as 14 for sex and paid would-be victims to recruit even more, to ensure a “steady supply of new victims to exploit”. He denies charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.In 2008 he admitted soliciting sex from an underage girl as part of a plea deal partly overseen by Alexander Acosta, the then-federal prosecutor for Florida who went on to become Mr Trump’s labour secretary.In a 2002 interview Mr Trump described Epstein as a “terrific guy” who was “a lot of fun to be with,” but has recently sought to distance himself from the disgraced figure, claiming they fell out “a long time ago”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

Sigh. Remember the good ol’ days of meaningless distractions?by 
    Mark Fiore July 18, 201912:15 PMStop the presses! The President is a racist! Okay, I guess we kinda’ sorta’ had a suspicion he might harbor racist feelings in his quieter moments. Now that it’s official, we can all agree that President Donald J. Trump is racist. Or at very least tweets racist things. (Not that anyone is allowed to say that in the House of Representatives.) In case you’re wondering, yes, I’m worried this might all be a distraction. But it is an unavoidable distraction that we must address. Damn, this guy is good.I’m not sure whether this is a distraction from Trump being compromised by foreign connections, a distraction from partying with a pedophile or a distraction from torturing 3-year-old children at the border. Unfortunately, they all must be addressed. Sigh.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.It comes as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned that the UK would have to “face the consequence” of a no-deal Brexit, and claimed that Ms May never suggested she would opt for a disorderly exit during the negotiations.Mr Lidington told BBC Panorama: “Martin [Selmayr] sort of said ‘look, why don’t we have a deal whereby we just put all this on ice for five years ... Let’s see how things go, let’s get the UK involved with France and Germany, let’s see how the dust settles and let’s talk about whether we can come to a new deal for Europe’”.When asked if he was tempted to explore the offer further, Mr Lidington said: “I said, ‘look we’ve had a referendum.“Practically all of us in parliament said we were going to accept the result of that referendum whether it went our way or not ... and that matters in British democratic politics and I don’t think there can be going back on that”.In an explosive documentary, filmed before the Tory leadership contest was underway, Mr Selmayr also said he was ”very certain” the UK is not prepared for a no-deal Brexit.“We have followed the British debate and the British preparations very, very closely and we have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit – we don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border,” he said.“You would have to establish a lot of authorities in the United Kingdom that you don’t have at this moment in time so I think the European Union have been very well prepared for that – we could live with a hard Brexit.“We don’t think the same level of preparation is there on the UK side.”Mr Barnier, who has led the negotiations for Brussels, claimed Ms May and her team had never mentioned or threatened a no-deal Brexit during the lengthy talks.Asked if it was ever mentioned, he said: “No, no, I never listened to such a sentence. Never.”Mr Barnier said he believed the UK knew the EU would not respond to threats of a no deal.“I think that the UK side, which is well-informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we’ve never been impressed by such a threat. It’s not useful to use it.”He added: “We have put in the document [the withdrawal agreement] with the UK – not against the UK, with the UK – the legal answers to each and every point of uncertainty created by Brexit.

Trump's hands are too filthy to hold the fate of the nation, writes Susan SurfTone.The "clean hands doctrine" is a simple one based on the most basic rule of human conduct: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It is a guiding principle in the law of equity based on the concept of fairness that a civil court applies when the application of law is inadequate to resolve a matter. If a person comes to court seeking equitable relief or to present a defense based on equity, that person cannot have acted in a manner that violates basic equitable principles. One must come to the court with clean hands to successfully claim equitable relief. Dirty hands will not be rewarded in a court of equity.When a candidate for public office seeks your vote, should that man or woman come to you with hands that are reasonably clean? We live in an imperfect world, and humans are flawed. It is not realistic to expect perfection in those aspiring to hold public office, but we have a sitting president with hands drenched in mud. His hands are the dirtiest of any person to hold the highest office in the land, to be our commander in chief, to lead the free world, and to hold lives in those soiled hands. He wants reelection in 2020 as he continues to divide us through the ugly call of racism. From his Central Park Five ads, his leading role in birtherism to Charlottesville, brown-skinned people seeking entry into our country in held cages, dog whistles at rallies, and statements to the press that catch the ear of any white nationalist, we know Donald Trump as a man who stokes fear among those who see him as their savior from a changing America.The 2020 presidential election will be another exercise in lies, Russian interference, false equivalency, conflation, false accusations against whoever his Democratic opponent is, outrageous tweets aimed to distract from real news he doesn’t like, and it will be worse than 2016. This time he will do it all from a podium with the presidential seal. He has Attorney General William Barr, who will protect him at every turn, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has destroyed the Republican Party to confirm judges who will in turn destroy the federal courts. Are there any clean hands left in the ruins of the Republican Party? It is doubtful, as one cannot remain silent as Trump tramples the Constitution and blatantly appeals to the racists among us and then claim clean hands.America has led the post-World War II international order because, although we are not perfect, other nations perceived us as having the cleanest hands in the international community. Not anymore. Former allies do not recognize us as Trump courts the autocrats of the world and threatens to drag the world into a darkness we thought would never return. We are a nation that rips children from their parents and then mistreats them in the cruelest of ways. Threats of mass immigration raids are used as a campaign tool. We are a nation that ignores the murder of a journalist, one of ours, by a foreign nation with a shrug of a shoulder.People of color, transgender men and women, the rest of the LGBTQ community, and women are less safe in the United States since Donald Trump became president through an Electoral College win. For the first time since Roe v. Wade, a woman’s right to choose is in real jeopardy. Trump knows he will never win the popular vote in 2020, but the Electoral College can return him to office and keep him out of the reach of the federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. He will stoke the fears of white rural America and divide us according to where we live. Urban America is somehow not the “real” America. Urban votes have been diluted, and rural America could not care less. Voter suppression worked in 2016, and we can be sure 2020 will be a replay on steroids. He will tell any lie and invoke the degree of fear necessary to get those red states to give him the Electoral College again. A win is a win.Trump is not usually a long game player, but he is going to use his media fight with the "squad," Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, to force his Democratic opponent into tweets and sound bites that will enrage his base and frighten independents on the edge into his camp.Robert Mueller will give his testimony to Congress soon. We will clearly see the dirty hands of Donald Trump, but will enough of us be listening and will enough of us care to impeach him? Will enough of his supporters be convinced his hands are too dirty for a second term? Ultimately, each voter must determine for himself or herself how dirty a president’s hands can be.Susan SurfTone is a musician, former FBI agent, and regular contributor to The Advocate.

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh admitted that Republican fear-mongering over the federal deficit under President Obama was “bogus,” while defending the deficit's explosive rise to $1 trillion under President Trump.During Limbaugh’s show on Tuesday, a caller suggested that Republicans should nominate a young fiscal conservative instead of Trump, citing the rising deficit. Limbaugh dismissed the concerns, declaring that fiscal conservatism was basically a sham all along.“Republicans can nominate a young, potentially two-term president, one that believes in fiscal conservatism,” the caller told Limbaugh. “We’re gonna have — in 2019, there’s gonna be a $1 trillion deficit. Trump doesn’t really care about that. He’s not really a fiscal conservative. We don't, we have to acknowledge that Trump has been cruelly used.”“Nobody is a fiscal conservative anymore,” Limbaugh shot back. “All this talk about concern for the deficit and the budget has been bogus for as long as it’s been around.”That’s quite the statement from Limbaugh, who spent the entirety of the Obama years attacking the president over rising deficits. In 2009, Limbaugh ranted that Obama was a “coward” without the “spine” or “gonads” to admit he was responsible for driving up the deficit (rather than the two wars President George W. Bush started while cutting taxes). In 2011, Limbaugh bizarrely claimed that Obama was "the architect of deficits and debt unheard of in this nation."The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spent the entirety of his 2008 presidential campaign warning about rising deficits, CNN noted. The 2010 rise of the Tea Party, which fueled massive Republican gains in that year's midterm elections, was fueled largely by claims that federal spending was out of control. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan made an entire career out of rhetoric decrying the rising national debt. Then he led the charge to approve a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the rich and corporations, leading to the $1 trillion deficit Republicans apparently no longer care about.Trump himself vowed to be a savior, promising that he would eliminate not just the budget deficit but the entire $22 trillion debt within two terms as president during his 2016 campaign. "It can be done. ... It will take place and it will go relatively quickly. ... If you have the right people, like, in the agencies and the various people that do the balancing ... you can cut the numbers by two pennies and three pennies and balance a budget quickly and have a stronger and better country,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in 2016.Later on Tuesday’s show, Limbaugh doubled down on his newfound believe that fiscal conservatism was never authentic, accusing former Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., of fear-mongering for expressing concern over the rising national debt under Trump. (Sanford has proposed mounting a campaign against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020.)"How many years have people tried to scare everybody about the deficit?" Limbaugh asked. "The years, how many decades of politicians tried to scare us about deficit the national debt, the deficit, any number of things. And yet, here we're still here and the great jaws of the deficit have not bitten off our heads and chewed them up and spit them out."

Chicago Police Board finds the officers exaggerated the threat posed by the 17-year-old to justify his shooting Associated Press

Thu 18 Jul 2019 22.15 EDT

The Chicago Police Board on Thursday fired four police officers for allegedly covering up a white officer’s 2014 fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald.The nine-member board found the officers exaggerated the threat posed by the 17-year-old McDonald to justify his shooting by Jason Van Dyke and voted unanimously for the dismissal of Sgt Stephen Franko and officers Janet Mondragon, Daphne Sebastian and Ricardo Viramontes.The police superintendent Eddie Johnson in 2016 accused the officers of either giving or approving knowingly false statements. None of the four were charged criminally, however they were stripped of police powers and assigned to desk duty as their case proceeded.A Cook county judge acquitted three other officers in January of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and official misconduct charges in the case.Former officer Joseph Walsh, officer Thomas Gaffney and former detective David March were charged with obstruction of justice, conspiracy and official misconduct.Prosecutors said they lied to shield Van Dyke from prosecution. A judge rejected the contention that a video of McDonald’s death proved police officers staged a cover-up.McDonald was carrying a small knife in 2014 when Van Dyke exited his squad car and almost immediately opened fire. Police video released in 2015 showed Van Dyke firing 16 bullets into McDonald, many after the teen had crumpled to the ground. Jurors convicted Van Dyke of murder in October. He’s serving a more than six-year prison term.The McDonald case has roiled the criminal justice system in Chicago. The then police superintendent, Gerry McCarty, was fired by then-mayor Rahm Emanuel and the then top prosecutor, Cook county state’s attorney Anita Alvarez, was ousted by voters.Many believe Emanuel decided against running for a third term because of the case. It also led to a US Justice Department investigation that found a “pervasive cover-up culture” and prompted plans for far-reaching police reforms. 


FRIENDS: Former Russian tycoon Alexander Temerko (right) counts Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to be Britain’s next PM, among his friends. Photo from Alexander Temerko's websitePublicly, industrialist and Conservative Party donor Alexander Temerko presents himself as an opponent of Brexit and a dissident critic of Vladimir Putin. In conversations with this reporter, he’s voiced strong support for Boris Johnson’s bid to lead Britain out of the EU, praised senior Russian intelligence officials and spoken about his past work with the Kremlin.By Catherine BeltonFiled July 19, 2019, 9 a.m. GMTLONDON - For almost a decade, Alexander Temerko, who forged a career at the top of the Russian arms industry and had connections at the highest levels of the Kremlin, has been an influential figure in British politics. He’s one of the Conservative Party’s major donors. He counts Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to be Britain’s next PM, among his friends.Temerko, born in what was then Soviet Ukraine, presents himself in public as an entrepreneur who opposes Britain’s departure from the European Union because it’s bad for his UK energy business, and as a dissident critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Related contentTimeline: Key dates for Britain's Brexit crisis - Choosing a new prime ministerGenius or joker? British PM favourite Johnson set to face the worldBut in more than half a dozen conversations with this reporter, conducted over the past three years as part of research for a book, he showed a different side of his career and views.Temerko revealed himself to be a supporter of Johnson’s bid to lead Britain out of the EU, describing the 2016 public vote to leave the bloc as a “revolution against bureaucracy.” He praised senior Russian security officials, including the current and former heads of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the KGB, and proudly recalled his past work with Russia’s Defence Ministry.These new insights into Temerko’s private thinking about Johnson, Brexit and Russia come as the ruling Conservative Party is choosing its next leader, and as some British MPs are increasingly wary of possible Russian influence over British politics. The result of the Conservative Party leadership contest is expected on July 23.Temerko has gifted more than £1 million to the Conservatives since he gained British citizenship in 2011, electoral finance records show - a significant amount by UK standards.Johnson is not among the politicians recorded as having received donations from Temerko. But the industrialist has financed some of Johnson’s important allies in parliament, including one of the men running his campaign for the Tory leadership, James Wharton, who also serves as a paid adviser to the UK energy firm where Temerko is a director. Temerko spoke warmly about his “friend” Johnson, telling how the two men sometimes call each other “Sasha,” the Russian diminutive for Alexander, which is Johnson’s real first name. He described how, at the beginning of Johnson’s tenure as Foreign Secretary from 2016 to 2018, they would often “plot” late into the evening over a bottle of wine on the balcony of Johnson’s office at parliament in Westminster. Johnson’s press secretary Lee Cain didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment for this article. The Conservative Party said only that “donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and fully comply with the law.”In one conversation in February this year, Temerko said he’d joined an unsuccessful attempt led by members of a group of hardline Conservative MPs, the European Research Group,  to remove Theresa May as leader in December 2018. The MPs were unhappy at May’s failure to take Britain out of the EU almost three years after Britons voted to leave. Temerko didn’t detail his role in the move, but a senior Conservative Party member confirmed that Temerko was “very much behind the attempt to oust” May. The party member declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. May finally resigned on June 7.  Jacob Rees Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, said in response to Reuters’ questions that Temerko “has no link formal or informal” with the group. Rees Mogg said he didn’t know Temerko, but couldn’t speak for Temerko’s relationship with individual MPs. May’s office referred Reuters’ questions about the episode to the Conservative Party, which didn’t comment.In the same conversation in February, Temerko spoke in positive terms about one of Putin’s closest and most powerful allies, Nikolai Patrushev, the hawkish head of Russia’s Security Council and former long-time head of the FSB security service, describing him as a “decent family man.” On another occasion, he said of Patrushev, “There is much more positive than negative about him.”One of Temerko’s former business partners in Russia, Leonid Nevzlin, said Temerko had long-standing ties with Russian security agencies, but declined to say whether he believes those ties remain active. Nevzlin and Temerko were shareholders in oil firm Yukos, before Putin’s government seized control of the company. Nevzlin, who was one of the main shareholders, said Yukos’s management brought Temerko in “for several projects as well as for his contacts at the top of the Federal Security Service and the Defence Ministry.” Nevzlin added that Temerko knew Patrushev “well.”Asked to respond, Temerko said in a follow-up interview this week that his role at Yukos encompassed the oil company’s connections with the entire Russian state, not just with the Defence Ministry. His relations with people in the security services, he added, were “formal” and not “personal.” He denied having any ongoing links with Russian security services. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Temerko “has no connection to the Kremlin or the Russian authorities. We do not know this gentleman.” Reuters couldn’t reach Patrushev for comment.“Jeremy is very dangerous. He really does occupy the centre ground. He’s very clever. He’s a person of the system.”Asked this week about the apparent contradiction between his private and public statements on Brexit, Temerko said his views changed with time and he was “evolutionary.” He said he joined the push to oust May because he thought she should be more flexible in negotiating a route out of the EU.In recent weeks, as Johnson’s campaign gathered pace, Temerko has appeared to distance himself from his friend. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in June, Temerko said he was switching support from Johnson to his rival, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, over Johnson’s apparent willingness to take Britain out of the EU without securing an agreement over the terms of the withdrawal. Temerko repeated this stance in a blog post for the Huffington Post on July 3, calling for Conservatives to reject the “fairytale” being offered by the “fun blonde guy,” a reference to the fair-haired Johnson.As recently as February, Temerko told this reporter: “Jeremy is very dangerous. He really does occupy the centre ground. He's very clever. He’s a person of the system.” There is no record of Temerko providing any financing to Hunt, and none of Temerko’s longstanding allies work on the Hunt campaign. A spokesperson for Hunt declined to comment.“We know the Kremlin seeks to disrupt, destabilise and influence our democracy in a number of ways.”This portrait of Temerko and his activity comes as some MPs worry about possible Russian interference in British democracy. In February this year, parliament’s committee overseeing digital and media matters called on the government to investigate attempts by Russia to influence the June 2016 referendum on Britain’s EU membership, amid growing evidence in the United States and elsewhere that the Kremlin has been pursuing a campaign to divide and disrupt Western democracies.Ben Bradshaw, a senior Labour parliamentarian who was the first MP to raise concern about potential Kremlin interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum, said Reuters’ findings were “extremely troubling.” “We know the Kremlin seeks to disrupt, destabilise and influence our democracy in a number of ways. We must have complete confidence that the close relationships between Conservative politicians and Russian business people with ties to the Putin regime are above board and free from Kremlin influencing operations. The fact that an ex Tory MP who is running Johnson’s leadership campaign is employed by Mr Temerko is extraordinary.”The senior Conservative with knowledge of Temerko’s efforts to remove May said some members of the party had distanced themselves from the businessman in recent months, as concerns have grown over Temerko’s Russian connections. But “others,” he said with reference to Johnson, were “still close.” The party member indicated that Conservative Chairman Brandon Lewis and Sir Graham Brady, then the head of the Conservative Party’s 1922 Committee, a parliamentary group, had been briefed about these concerns. The source declined to give further details about the briefings. Brady did not respond to an emailed request for comment. A spokesperson for Lewis declined to comment. The Conservative Party didn’t comment.Electoral Commission records show Temerko, and UK companies linked to him, have made donations to 11 individual MPs, including Lewis, the chairman of the Tory Party, while helping fund as many as 27 local branches of the Conservative Party in areas where Tory MPs won election in the north of England, Wales and London. There is no record of him providing funds to Johnson or to his constituency, and this year much of his funding activity seems to have petered out.In the February 2019 conversation, as May faced overwhelming parliamentary opposition to her EU withdrawal agreement, Temerko forecast that if Brexit isn’t implemented, “the time of the mainstream parties will end,” and “the old system will be destroyed.” His friend Johnson, he predicted then, could lead a new movement backing Brexit.Those comments about a new political era chimed with remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an interview with the Financial Times in June, Putin trumpeted the rise of national populist movements in Europe and the United States, saying that “the liberal idea has become obsolete.” Putin has rarely commented directly on Brexit, which he says is a matter for the British people. At his annual press conference in December 2018, he decried the idea of holding a second referendum on Brexit and said the UK government had to implement Britain’s departure from the EU, otherwise faith in democratic procedures would be undermined.From Russia to LondonTemerko rose to prominence in the Russia arms industry in the 1990s, in the wild days that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.Three former Russian business partners, including Nevzlin, as well as a former Russian intelligence officer, said Temerko grew close with the Russian security services. Those ties were forged in the 1990s, these people said, when Temerko served as head of a state committee for the military and later as head of a strategic Russian state arms company known as Russkoye Oruzhie, or Russian Weapons. Russkoye Oruzhie no longer exists.Temerko cultivated close relations with the Russian defence minister of the early 1990s, Pavel Grachev. Temerko has described the late Grachev as his “handler.” Temerko has boasted to this reporter that he himself had three-star and four-star Russian generals working under him.In 1999, Temerko became a member of the board and significant shareholder at one of the new Russia’s most successful companies, Yukos, led by the charismatic billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Temerko said he helped Yukos secure a lucrative contract to supply the Russian army with oil. As head of the firm’s government relations, he’d also led a push by Yukos to build an oil pipeline to China and, according to one of the former business partners, he’d travelled with other Yukos officials on many business trips they made abroad.“He knew the Russian ambassadors and consuls of every country,” this former business partner said. Temerko said he knew many but not all of them.Things went sour for Yukos when Khodorkovsky tried to build a political power base for himself.When Khodorkovsky was arrested and jailed on fraud charges in October 2003, Temerko was the only Yukos shareholder who remained in the country to negotiate with the Kremlin. The remaining shareholders fled fearing they would face arrest. Temerko told how his standing with the Kremlin was such that he was able to try to negotiate about ways to preserve Yukos and secure Khodorkovsky’s release directly with Igor Sechin, the then-deputy head of the Kremlin administration and the Putin security man seen as the mastermind behind the Kremlin campaign to take over Yukos. Temerko said that in those days his status meant he was essentially untouchable. His security ties, he said, once got him access to a meeting of the Russian Security Council, the circle of 24 top Russian officials, chaired by Putin, who steer national security policy.In the event, Khodorkovsky remained in jail for 10 years, while Temerko also fled. Sechin has previously denied orchestrating the legal campaign to take over Yukos. Sechin could not be reached for comment for this article.New friends in high placesTemerko arrived in Britain in 2005, saying he was a refugee from the politically charged takeover of Yukos. The Russian government had charged him with defrauding the state oil major Rosneft. Temerko denied the charge, saying the case was part of the Russian government’s campaign against Yukos and its former top managers. The High Court in London declined a Russian request for Temerko’s extradition in December 2005, saying it was politically motivated. The case bolstered his standing as a Russian dissident who’d suffered at the hands of the Russian state, helping secure his footing as a donor who could be trusted.Temerko won entrée to the top of the Conservative Party during David Cameron’s premiership that began in 2010. At the time, according to Russian financier and Conservative Party activist, Sergei Cristo, the Tories were seeking new sources of cash following the 2008 financial crisis. Temerko paid £90,000 for a bronze bust of Cameron at a fundraising auction in 2013, now displayed at the Carlton Club, an exclusive London private members club. Cameron couldn’t be reached for comment.Temerko’s donations translated into access. In 2014, he was appointed by the local branch of the party as a vice-president of the Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association, which delivered even greater opportunity to mix with leading Tories. Temerko also became part of Conservative Party donor club The Leader’s Group, where £50,000 in annual membership fees grants access to the prime minister and other senior ministers at dinners, cocktail receptions and other events. In the conversations of the last three years, Temerko boasted he played an important role in securing election victories for the Conservative Party at a time when it “was fighting for every vote.”Together with OGN Group, a major steel manufacturer in the UK’s northeast, where he served as director, he said he’d sponsored 40 members of parliament in previous elections. “My business was one of the biggest businesses that supported the Conservative Party and its deputies in northern England,” he said in the February 2019 conversation, adding he’d brought in supporters from Britain’s East European minority. OGN Group is now in liquidation. The Conservative Party didn’t comment.In public remarks, Temerko has consistently said he opposes Brexit because it will damage his UK business interests, which now centre on a firm, Aquind Ltd, developing an undersea electric power link between Britain and France. On his website he says he is a “vocal supporter” of British membership of the EU.While Temerko has publicly spoken out against Brexit, and has made donations to parliamentarians who campaigned to remain in the EU, at least two Conservative politicians close to Temerko played key roles on the Brexit side in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum.One of them is Wharton, a former Conservative MP who is overseeing Johnson’s leadership campaign, at the same time as being a paid adviser to the power firm Aquind Ltd where Temerko is a director. In June 2013, Wharton put forward the parliamentary bill that first called for a referendum on Britain’s EU membership. Temerko made £25,000 in political donations to Wharton between 2013 and 2015, disclosures to parliament show, a relatively large figure for an individual British MP, helping fund his re-election in 2015 in a constituency neighbouring Temerko’s OGN Group steel works. Wharton didn’t respond to a request for comment.The minister of state for exiting the EU, Martin Callanan, served on the board of Temerko’s Aquind from May 2016 to June 2017, at which time he joined the government. Callanan didn’t respond to a request for comment.In a conversation with this reporter in July 2016, shortly after Britons voted to leave the EU, Temerko was jubilant about the possibilities of Johnson leading Britain’s exit from the bloc. By then, Johnson was the most powerful figure in the “Leave” campaign.“We know that if Boris is our elected leader then our party membership will grow. There would be massive support for our party at election,” he said at the time. The vote to leave the EU, he added, was “a revolution against bureaucracy.”During the same conversation, Temerko said “a group of East European businessmen” had helped sway Johnson into siding in February 2016 with campaigners for Britain’s departure from the EU after months of sitting on the fence. But Temerko declined to name any of these East European businessmen and declined to repeat this comment.Temerko’s allies are at the helm of Johnson’s campaign.  Wharton, the adviser to Temerko’s power firm Aquind Ltd, has overseen the day to day running of Johnson’s campaign, particularly in its initial stages.Gavin Williamson, the former UK defence secretary whom Temerko has frequently described as “a good lad,” helped lead Johnson’s campaign to win the support of his parliamentary colleagues to replace Theresa May. Conservative parliamentarians whittled the field down to two candidates in a series of votes in June before handing the final choice to the party’s estimated 160,000 members. Williamson declined to comment. Temerko says he is “friends” with political strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, whose firm, CTF Partners, gave Johnson a £20,000 interest free loan and a £3,000 cash donation late last year, according to a disclosure to parliament by Johnson. A co-founder of CTF, Mark Fullbrook, is the Johnson campaign’s chief executive. Crosby declined to comment. CTF says it isn’t involved in the Johnson campaign and Fullbrook is on a leave of absence, working voluntarily for Johnson’s leadership bid.reuters investigatesMore Reuters investigations and long-form narrativesGot a confidential news tip?

He has told this reporter he is now persona non-grata with the Russian authorities, especially after he publicly called in 2015 for the UK to supply weapons to Ukraine to assist it in its war with pro-Kremlin separatists on the grounds that only a show of force would stop the conflict. “They consider that I am among those who directed the UK government against them. I am a warmonger. I am more of an enemy now than when I was in Yukos,” he said.Kremlin spokesman Peskov said he couldn’t comment because he doesn’t know who Temerko is.Temerko retains at least one powerful connection, however. One of Temerko’s former business partners said the industrialist is in contact with Andrei Guryev, the owner of Russian fertilizer giant Phosagro. Guryev, too, has become a notable figure in Britain. He owns Witanhurst, a vast estate in Highgate in the north of London that is the UK’s second biggest house after Buckingham Palace.

NEW YORK, NY – JULY 08: US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announces charges against Jeffery Epstein on July 8, 2019 in New York City. Epstein will be charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. We already knew that Judge Richard Berman decided Thursday that wealthy accused child sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein would not be granted bail, calling Epstein a “danger to the community.” Now we have the opportunity to read the full 33-page order explaining why the judge ruled as he did. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from the filing.1. Government’s evidence that Epstein is a danger to the community is “clear and convincing.”2. Judge: Epstein’s attraction to young girls “appears likely to be uncontrollable.”3. Defense argument that it’s “not like [Epstein is] an out-of-control rapist” doesn’t fly because, in the judge’s words, “it seems fair to say that Mr. Epstein’s future behavior will be consistent with past behavior.” Berman then pointed to the discovery of a “trove” of lewd photos of young-looking women or girls found during the raid of Epstein’s Upper East Side townhouse.5. “Photographic trophies of his victims and other young females” suggests Epstein “poses ‘ongoing and forward-looking danger.'”6. Judge bolded evidence of witness intimidation and threats.7. Judge notes that, despite the defense pointing to Epstein’s New Mexico behavior, Epstein has “challenged his sex offender ‘level’ in at least one jurisdiction since 2008 in an effort to minimize his reporting obligations.” Berman also noted reports saying Epstein was allowed by NYPD to skip mandatory sex offender check-in.8. The pretrial service report listed myriad reasons Epstein is a flight risk; judge says Epstein is a “classic” flight risk.9. Judge: the Government’s evidence against Epstein “appears strong” for numerous reasons.10. Given the “totality of the circumstances,” the government has met its burden to keep Epstein jailed.You can read the full document below.Judge BermanJeffrey Epstein… by Law&Crime on Scribd[Image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images]Matt Naham is managing editor of Law&Crime.

Wagga GP says Australia’s deputy prime minister told meeting past recordings of temperature ‘were not as accurately measured’
Ben Smee

Thu 18 Jul 2019 22.09 EDT


Last modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 23.51 EDT

Australia’s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had told a constituent in Wagga Wagga he disputed evidence of global heating because historical weather measurements might be inaccurate, according to notes from a meeting last month.The Wagga City Council, at the heart of McCormack’s electorate, declared a climate change emergency last week.The remarkable statement by the city leaders, in a normally conservative part of the country susceptible to extremes of drought, fire and flood, has intensified local pressure on McCormack to clarify his position. The deputy prime minister has previously made some sceptical statements and has suggested praying for rain to combat the drought.Wagga-based general practitioner Dr Trudi Beck, who has been central to a community push for the council’s climate emergency declaration, met McCormack at his office on 24 June.In notes she made immediately after the meeting, which she sent to McCormack and which were noted by a staffer who was present, Beck detailed comments made by the Riverina MP.“When asked if [McCormack believed] in climate change [he] stated that the climate has always been changing and made reference to various flood and drought events over the past 120 years,” the meeting notes say.“When asked what [McCormack] would make of data from meteorological agencies that 18 of the 19 hottest years on record have been in the last 18 years [he] suggested that earlier measurements of temperature by agencies such as the Bureau of Meteorology were not as accurately measured.”Beck and other community members in Wagga have begun “Fridays for the Future” demonstrations, where they picnic in a small park near McCormack’s office. Beck says the deputy prime minister told her she should abandon the actions and “do something useful like volunteer for Meals on Wheels instead”.McCormack told Guardian Australia that “a meeting was held with a constituent at her request to discuss climate” but did not elaborate when asked about his purported comments, or to make clear his personal view.“There was an exchange of views and the constituent was given an understanding of the government’s actions on climate. The government is taking responsible and affordable action on environmental issues which are of concern to people not just in Wagga Wagga but throughout Australia,” he said.“This has to be achieved in a responsible manner without de-industrialising our nation and driving energy costs through the roof.”Beck said she had initially thought McCormack would be open to a conversation.“The kinds of points he was raising with me were the same kinds of points I’ve heard people who do not believe in anthropogenic climate change bringing up,” she said.The Wagga city council will vote again on Monday, after some councillors launched an attempt to rescind the emergency declaration. McCormack did not express a view on the local debate but did say that “addressing global environmental issues, including those relating to climate, requires a global solution”.


TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The Latest on developments related to tensions between the U.S and Iran (all times local):3:10 p.m.The head of Gibraltar’s government says he met privately with Iran’s foreign minister to defuse tensions surrounding the seizure of an Iranian supertanker near the British overseas territory.Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told parliament on Friday that the meeting in London with Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier this week “was both constructive and positive.”Picardo says he wants to “de-escalate” after the interception of the Panama-flagged tanker off the southern tip of Spain on July 4.The tanker is suspected of carrying Iranian oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions on Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, and its seizure stoked international tensions over the Persian Gulf.Picardo says he met with Zarif at the Foreign Office in London on Wednesday. He says he told Zarif that due process of law must be followed and that the case is before Gibraltar’s Supreme Court.___3 p.m.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is praising French President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to facilitate talks between Iran and the United States, saying diplomatic efforts are critical.Merkel told reporters on Friday that “every possibility for contact should be sought to prevent an escalation.”Since the U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran last year, the other parties to the agreement — Germany, France, Britain, Russia, China and the European Union — have been trying to preserve it.But Merkel says “the fact that we are keeping to this agreement doesn’t mean that we don’t see a lot of what Iran is doing very critically, like the influence on Syria, the attitude to Israel, the influence in the Yemen war concerns us a lot, the ballistic missile program.”She says that “outside the agreement, there is good reason for further talks with Iran about these activities.”___2:50 p.m.China has praised an Iranian offer to speed up ratification of an agreement on access to its nuclear sites, while criticizing the latest U.S. sanctions on Chinese and other entities for allegedly helping Iran buy materials for its nuclear program.Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday that the offer from Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sends “a positive signal that Iran is willing to seek a compromise solution.”The Iranian parliament is not due to ratify the agreement with the International Atomic Energy Association until 2023.The U.S. has imposed new sanctions on companies and individuals in Iran, China and Belgium.Geng said China opposes America’s “long-armed jurisdiction over other countries, including China.” He called U.S. unilateral sanctions the root cause of the current tension.___2:40 p.m.Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard says it will release images taken by a drone that President Donald Trump says was hit by a U.S. warship to disprove his claim.The Guard’s website, sepahnews.com, published a statement on Friday saying these images will show the Guard’s drone had been carrying out its regular mission as the USS Boxer arrived in the Strait of Hormuz.It didn’t say when the images would be released.Trump on Thursday said the USS Boxer took defensive action after an Iranian drone came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.The Guard said the drone sent images before and after the time the Americans claimed the aircraft was destroyed on Thursday. The Iranian drone reportedly later returned to base safely.The statement added that Guard forces continue to carefully monitor all movements of foreigners — especially “the terrorist forces” of the U.S. and the British in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf.___2:25 p.m.An Iranian lawmaker says the U.S. president is seeking to increase tensions in the Persian Gulf region by “falsely claiming” that a U.S. warship targeted an Iranian drone.Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, spokesman of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, says that “with such allegations, America plans to create tensions and psychological warfare in the region and in Iran, and hide its failures.”His remarks were carried by the semi-official ISNA news agency on Friday.President Donald Trump on Thursday said an American warship, the USS Boxer, took defensive action after an Iranian drone came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.Hosseini also added that “Trump’s claim is not endorsed by anyone, because it is not true.”___11:40 a.m.An Iranian news agency is reporting that the country’s armed forces say all Iranian drones in the Persian Gulf returned safely to their bases.The report comes after President Donald Trump on Thursday said an American warship, the USS Boxer, took defensive action after an Iranian drone came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.The semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted military spokesman Gen. Abolfazl Shekari as saying on Friday that “all Iranian drones that are in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, including the one which the U.S. president mentioned, after carrying out scheduled identification and control missions, have returned to their bases.”Gen. Shekarchi also said there have been no reports of any confrontation between the USS Boxer and an Iranian drone.___10:30 a.m.Iran is denying a U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the strategic Strait of Hormuz after it threatened the ship.Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi tweeted on Friday: “We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else.”Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is in New York for U.N. meetings, said there’s “no information about losing a drone.”President Donald Trump on Thursday said the USS Boxer took defensive action after an Iranian drone closed to within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.The incident marked a new escalation of tensions between the countries, less than one month after Iran downed an American drone in the same waterway and Trump came close to retaliating with a military strike.


By John CassidyJuly 18, 2019The effort to impeach Donald Trump has been steadily gaining support among Democrats.On Wednesday afternoon, Representative Al Green, who since 2005 has represented Texas’s Ninth Congressional District, stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and read from a resolution to impeach Donald Trump. “Donald John Trump is unfit to be President,” Green said. “Unfit to represent the American values of decency and morality, respectability and civility, honesty and propriety . . . unfit to insure domestic tranquillity, promote the general welfare, and to insure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, as lauded in the preamble of the U.S. Constitution.”To make his case, Green, who was also responsible for previous efforts to impeach Trump, pointed to Trump’s long history of trying to sow racial divisions, including his inflammatory tweets over the weekend about four Democratic members of Congress who are all women of color. The damage that Trump has inflicted on the United States was so grave, Green concluded, that it warrants “impeachment, trial, and removal from office.”Later in the day, the House voted, three hundred and thirty-two votes to ninety-five, to “table”—i.e., sideline—Green’s resolution. When Trump arrived in Greenville, South Carolina, on Wednesday evening, for a campaign rally, he hailed the vote, saying, “We’ve just received an overwhelming vote against impeachment, and that’s the end of it.”Actually, that was more of Trump’s wishful thinking. Far from marking a finish to anything, the seemingly lopsided vote demonstrated that the movement to impeach Trump is steadily gaining support in the Democratic caucus. For now, a majority of Democratic representatives, including the Party’s leadership, don’t believe that the time is right to launch impeachment proceedings. But the efforts to impeach Trump are far from over.When interpreting Wednesday’s vote tally, it is important to keep a number of things in mind. First, this wasn’t an up-down vote on whether Trump should be impeached. It was a vote on a motion to set aside Green’s motion, which cited Trump’s racist tweets over the weekend, and which otherwise would have gone to a floor vote. In effect, the motion represented an agreement not to decide the impeachment question right now, which is the strategy that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of the Democratic leadership have settled on. Even so, ninety-five Democrats, out of a total of two hundred and thirty-five, voted against the motion—signalling that they favored an immediate start to some sort of impeachment proceeding or inquiry.That figure represents substantial movement. In December, 2017, when the House voted to table Green’s first impeachment motion, which cited Trump’s comments about there being “very fine people” on both sides of the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, just fifty-eight Democrats voted to keep it alive. In January, 2018, when Green tried again, sixty-six Democrats sided with him.The ninety-five votes that were cast on Wednesday in support of Green’s most recent resolution represented about forty per cent of all Democratic representatives. Another way to look at it is that the forces demanding a rapid move to impeachment fell just twenty-three votes short of achieving majority status in the Democratic caucus. (To get there, they would need a hundred and eighteen votes.)Moreover, it’s clear that the level of support for Green’s resolution understated the support for impeachment. Among the Democrats who voted to table Green’s motion were a number of prominent impeachment supporters who, following Tuesday’s unanimous vote by House Democrats to condemn Trump’s racist comments, didn’t think this was the most opportune moment to move ahead. “We’re trying to keep the caucus together as we respond to the most lawless administration of our lifetimes,” Representative Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, told the Washington Post. “I’m enough of a political pragmatist to believe that you call votes when you think you can win them, not when you think you can lose them.”It’s also worth looking at who among the Democrats voted nay on Wednesday. Not so long ago, support for moving rapidly to impeachment was a position adopted, mainly, by those on the left of the Party. Now it has gone mainstream. An article at The Hill noted that a number of powerful committee chairs broke with the Party leadership. They included Nita Lowey (Appropriations), Bennie Thompson (Energy and Commerce), Raúl Grijalva (Homeland Security), Jerry Nadler (Judiciary), Jim McGovern (Rules), and Nydia Velázquez (Small Business).What explained the votes of such Party stalwarts? Certainly, they are disgusted by Trump. In many districts, they are also facing intense pressure from constituents and activists. As Thompson said on Wednesday, “My district wants me to vote for the immediate impeachment of Donald Trump.”To be sure, Thompson represents a deep blue area of western Mississippi. It is sometimes said that Democrats, when facing competitive races in 2020, will never support impeaching Trump, but that isn’t necessarily true. Citing her responsibility to uphold the law, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who represents Arizona’s Second District, said, “I’ve come to the conclusion that the House of Representatives must open an impeachment inquiry.” Kirkpatrick was following the example of several other Democrats in competitive districts, including Tom Malinowski, of New Jersey, and Katie Porter, of California.On this occasion, Pelosi and her leadership colleagues were able to hold the line, but things are still moving. On Thursday, Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic Presidential candidates reiterated their support for opening an impeachment inquiry. Next week, Robert Mueller will deliver his long-awaited testimony on Capitol Hill. If the former special counsel spells out, in plain English, what the second volume of his report says in legalese—his investigators uncovered numerous instances of Trump trying to obstruct justice, and it is Congress’s responsibility to take up the matter—the calls for impeachment will grow even louder.John Cassidy has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922July 18, 2019 (Mainichi Japan)
    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- The number of recorded crimes in Japan continued to decline in the first half of 2019, with the full-year figure expected to reach its lowest postwar level for the fifth consecutive year, police said Thursday.

    

    In the first six months of this year, crimes dropped 8.7 percent from a year earlier to 363,846, due mainly to fewer reported theft cases, which account for over 70 percent of the total, according to a preliminary report from the National Police Agency.

    

    An NPA official also pointed to the country's aging demographics and widespread use of crime prevention resources as factors contributing to the decline.

    

    The full-year crime figure has continued to drop from a peak in 2002 when 2,853,739 cases were recorded by police.

    

    In the January-June period, the number of crimes fell in all of the main categories, with felonies including murders and robberies down 5.1 percent to 2,352 and violent offenses such as assaults down 3.2 percent to 27,967.

    

    Theft cases decreased 9.1 percent to 257,183, crimes of moral turpitude such as indecent assaults slid 8.5 percent to 3,952 and white-collar crimes including fraud dropped 14.0 percent to 18,132.

    

    Those aged 65 or older accounted for 16.2 percent of total victims of crime and of those that were targeted in fraud cases 50.5 percent were elderly citizens.

    

    Senior citizens made up 80.6 percent of the total victims of fraud cases in which perpetrators impersonate the mark's children or their grandchildren and ask for urgent money transfers over the phone.

    

    By area, Tokyo saw the most crimes at 50,316, followed by 41,319 in Osaka. Akita in northeastern Japan was the most crime-free of the country's 47 prefectures with 996 crimes.

    

    Police took enforcement actions in 141,328 cases against 92,877 offenders, down 7.5 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively, with the number of juveniles subject to police action for crimes slipping 17.4 percent to 9,397.

 After  overcoming a legal challenge from Oracle, the Pentagon looked set to announce the winner of the $10 billion JEDI cloud contract in late August. Amazon and Microsoft were the finalists in the bidding process, with Amazon Web Services widely expected to walk away the winner.  But then  President Donald Trump stepped in.  Suddenly, the fate of one of the biggest public cloud deals ever was unclear — especially given President Trump's public feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  Trump said Thursday that he was looking into the Pentagon's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, project, a platform that will store and manage sensitive military and defense data. So far, Trump has said only that he's " very seriously" weighing an intervention.  "This is not good news for Amazon as Trump looks under the cover of the JEDI deal," Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told Business Insider. "There are risks for Microsoft as well … The biggest risk is around delaying timing and potentially looking at the possibility of not single-sourcing the deal."  Trump told reporters: "We're getting tremendous complaints from other companies. Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it." He mentioned Microsoft, Oracle and IBM, according to news reports.  In fact, only Oracle and IBM had protested through official channels — complaining that it was only slated to go to one cloud vendor, in a world where most large organizations use several cloud platforms in concert. Oracle went so far as to make an  ill-fated legal challenge, alleging improprieties on Amazon's part in the bidding process.                                                                                                                      The fact that Trump would go so far as to speak out on the deal is extraordinary on its own, said Christopher Cornillie, a Bloomberg Government analyst who covers government IT contracts.  "It's exceedingly rare for a senior political official to publicly intervene in an ongoing procurement," he told Business Insider. In fact, the White House "declined to do that" when  the JEDI issue was raised to Trump in April 2018, he added.  Cornillie said that if Trump chooses to intervene, he could either ask the Pentagon to delay the award pending an investigation, or to cancel the contract outright.  "In that case, the Pentagon could be forced to go back to the drawing board with its enterprise cloud contract, which would be most detrimental to Amazon - the favorite to win the contract in its current form," he said.                                                                                                                      But he noted that there are laws that "limit political interference" in government contracting. If the JEDI contract is cancelled, "Amazon and/or Microsoft may have recourse to sue the government for damages."  "If the president were to attempt to intervene in the procurement, Amazon could make the case that the White House overruled Pentagon procurement officials and a federal judge in a way favorable to its competitors," he said.  Oracle and other critics had argued that it didn't make sense for the Pentagon to award such a major contract to just one vendor. Cornillie said it's possible Trump shares the view offered by the JEDI contract critics "that entrusting so much of the Pentagon's data to a single company poses a security risk."  But Cornillie also noted that that view "runs counter to the analysis of his own Defense Department, which has stated repeatedly that JEDI is vital to national security."                                                                                                                      Oracle declined to comment on Trump's statements. In an email, an IBM spokesperson told Business Insider: "IBM has long raised serious concerns about the structure of the JEDI procurement. We continue to believe that the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform would be best served by a multi-cloud strategy."  On the other hand, Cornillie said, Amazon's frontrunner status in the contract fight and  Trump's bitter public feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is also the owner of the Washington Post, were factors in the unexpected twist in the JEDI saga.  "The president has made his feelings about Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and the Washington Post well-known, and he may find the prospect of denying Amazon a $10 billion contract irresistible," he said.  Ives of Wedbush echoed this view: "Given the ongoing Trump vs Bezos battle royale this can add a further wrench in the JEDI bake-off...Ultimately, this looks to be another round in the Bezos-versus-Trump boxing match on the horizon."

Donald Trump has come to the conclusion that many Americans hate their country. That could not be further from the truth.Most of us love America. What we hate is that the president has taken it into the gutter. In other words, Donald Trump, the problem isn’t the “Free, Beautiful and Very Successful” country you spoke about in a tweet Tuesday morning. The problem with America is you.Trump’s latest tweet telling Americans, “If you hate our Country or if you are not happy here, you can leave!” is yet another sign that he is out of touch with most of the country. It has exposed once again the mental cocoon in which he lives, sheltered from the truth.Americans don’t hate America. What they hate is that Trump is the president.The things that make us unhappy about America right now are directly related to Trump. He is the reason thousands of people across the country took to the streets in protest over the weekend after he promised to send federal agents into neighborhoods looking for immigrants to deport.He is the reason we lay restlessly in bed at night, thinking about innocent children held in deplorable conditions at detention centers along our southern border.He is the architect of this brutal ideological battle in America that cannot possibly result in a winner. Trump’s overt actions to normalize bigotry and racism have forced us to choose sides and retreat to the corners where other like-minded people reside. He has opened the floodgates of racial discord, ripped out all channels of communication and left us to figure out how to deal with it on our own.Trump has led us on a deliberate march to a dark and dreary place, where it is hard to see a glimpse of the light far off in the distance. But we know that we eventually will be delivered from this agony — because in America, resilience is part of our historical fabric.Americans have long been resigned to the fact that our country is imperfect. There has always been a lot to love about it, as well as a lot to hate. African Americans, in particular, are descendants of men and women who suffered some of the most egregious evils imaginable under the shelter of a misguided democracy. Our ancestors’ blood runs through our veins, and at times the ancestral pain strikes so deep that we scream out in pain. But black people’s stake in America’s success is no greater than anyone else’s.From the Scots, Irish and Germans who came to Chicago in the late 1800s to work in the steel mills to the Mexicans who worked in chicken factories in Georgia while encouraging their children to dream of a life much better than that, we are all the same.This kinship is the seamless connection that binds Americans with one another, and it is why Trump’s insensitive tweet reaches to our core and reinforces our commitment to fight for this nation that belongs to us. Trump is a threat to all of us.According to a Gallup Poll taken last month, 66 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States. Only 32 percent are satisfied. If everyone who is unhappy about the path America is on decided to take Trump’s advice to leave, we would be forfeiting our future to people who think like him. We would be turning our country over to a bunch of haters, of bigots and racists.We would be leaving America in the care of those who would ultimately destroy our “free, beautiful and very successful” home. What Trump does not understand is that most Americans are not like him at all. We don’t hate the way he hates. We don’t believe that immigrants are a burden on society that can be disposed of on a whim.We don’t look at people whose skin, religion or ethnic background is different from ours and see them as outsiders. We see contributors to the cultural diversity of our great nation, people with the same values as ours, who want to live in a country that is free, beautiful and very successful. They mirror exactly who we are.The sheer absurdity of Trump’s tweet sent the strongest signal yet that he has no comprehension of what it means to be a real American. He doesn’t understand how resilient Americans are, how accustomed we are to taking the good with the bad.He doesn’t realize just how much we care about this country. He doesn’t understand that we criticize it often because we know it has the potential to be better tomorrow than it was yesterday.So no, Donald Trump, Americans who dislike you and hate the way you are defacing our beautiful country aren’t going anywhere. We plan to stay right where we belong and force you and those who share your warped values to either leave or find a place to hide.dglanton@chicagotribune.com

I disagree with it,” Trump said.Asked why he did not stop the chants, the president insisted, “I think I did. I started speaking very quickly.”But then Trump later defended supporters who chanted “send her back” as being motivated by patriotism.“These are people that love our country. I want them to keep loving our country. And I think the congresswomen, by the way, should be more positive than they are,” he said, referring to Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley.The mixed messages from Trump are likely to raise questions for Republicans about what will happen if the chants start again at Trump’s next fally.The president in his comments later on Thursday afternoon reiterated that he was not happy with the chant but said the Democratic lawmakers “have a big obligation and the obligation is to love your country.”Juliegrace Brufke and Jordain Carney contributed. The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.

            Rep. Ilhan Omar, shown here at the Capitol on Thursday, has been a target of racist rhetoric from President Trump .Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the freshman Democratic congresswoman facing attacks from President Trump and his supporters, received a hero's welcome back at her home district in Minnesota on Thursday. A cheering crown at the airport in the Twin Cities held banners with slogans such as "Stop Racism Now" and chanted "Welcome Home Ilhan" as the congresswoman emerged from her flight. "We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president," she said into a megaphone, "because his policies are a nightmare to us. We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready."Watch the moment here, captured on video by Tom Hauser of KSTP:Congresswoman Omar just arrived back in the Twin Cities. pic.twitter.com/ZiFqWnDJgQThroughout this past week, Trump has targeted Omar and her fellow progressive congresswomen — New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley — with repeated attacks. In a tweet on Sunday, he said the four women of color should "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."And at a rally on Wednesday, Trump attacked each congresswoman individually. As he spoke about Omar, the crowd started to chant "send her back," echoing the president's tweet. Omar, an American citizen, came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia when she was a child. Trump attempted to distance himself from the racist chant on Thursday, saying "I wasn't happy with that message that they gave last night.""It was quite a chant, and I felt a little bit badly about it. But I will say this, I did — and I started speaking very quickly. But it started up rather fast," the president added.However, as NPR's Tamara Keith noted, "in reality, Trump stood there for 13 seconds as the chant continued, waiting for it to die down before he resumed his remarks."Omar traveled to the Twin Cities on Thursday to participate in a town hall to discuss "Medicare for All," as CNN reported. "I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to let them," Omar told the crowd. Earlier in the day, Omar told reporters in Washington, D.C. that she sees the president as a "fascist" and said she considered this fight about "what this country truly should be," according to The Associated Press.

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.“We will not go back to the days of injustice. We will not go back, we will go forward. But we sure as hell will not stand still.”The rally was a benefit for Democracy Summer, a programme that representative Jamie Raskin started more than a decade ago to train new generations of Democratic activists.Mr Raskin is not accustomed to drawing big crowds when he hosts fundraisers for the programme. But after his office announced Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s appearance last week, his phone began to ring endlessly.Within hours, all 700 tickets were gone, and his office had to start a waiting list.“Usually I’m the attraction, which tells you about our comparative popular appeal,” Mr Raskin said before the rally.Referring to Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s star power, he said: “She makes news when she gets a cup of water.”The congresswomen Mr Trump targeted – Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – are all women of colour.Ms Omar, a refugee from Somalia, is the only one born outside the United States. She returned home to Minneapolis on Thursday from Washington, and was greeted at the airport by enthusiastic crowds.Ms Ocasio-Cortez received a similar hero’s welcome at the civic centre, in the heart of Mr Raskin’s deep-blue district just outside Washington.“It has been a kind of crazy week, hasn’t it?” she said as she began her remarks.“America has always been the story of those fighting to advance the rights of others,” she continued. “And some, clinging to the past, to preserve the rights of a few.”Hundreds of people stood in long security lines in the stifling heat to get a glimpse of the 29-year-old Democrat. A choir sang folk songs as they waited.“She speaks very profoundly for the millennials my age coming from immigrant backgrounds,” said Samantha Labastida, 23, a child care provider from Wheaton. “She’s the voice we have been yearning for.”A few feet away, Tynan Jackson, 23, an Ohioan who is interning in Washington for the summer, said it’s Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s background as a political neophyte that attracts him.“She’s an outsider like Trump, but with her it’s a positive,” he said.“She doesn’t have any money, she’s from the Bronx, and she canvassed in shoes that whittled to the sole. She’s genuine.”But Jim Greenberg, a retired academic administrator who described himself as a pragmatist, said he worries that Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s “bombastic” criticism of establishment Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would harm the party.“It gives Trump and the Republicans ammunition,” he said. “She voices things at times that are not helpful to our side of the coin – the blue side.”In November, Ms Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest person elected to congress in November when she won her seat representing a district that stretches from the Bronx to Queens.She had ousted 10-term incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary, a victory that was widely regarded as the most surprising upset in the 2018 midterm elections.She has remained a force since taking office, pressing a progressive platform that includes Medicare-for-all, free public college, and a “Green New Deal” to address climate change and economic inequality.Ms Ocasio-Cortez and her three colleagues, who refer to themselves as “the Squad” on Capitol Hill, have tangled with fellow Democrats, including Ms Pelosi, who has portrayed them as marginal players in Washington.Mr Raskin – who works with Ms Ocasio-Cortez as the chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties – predicted when he introduced her on Thursday night that she would be “one of the greatest members of the Congress of the 21st century”.He described her victorious campaign as a “historic inspiration.”When it was her turn, Ms Ocasio-Cortez returned the favour, saying Mr Raskin was the kind of lawmaker she was hoping to find when she reached Washington – “voraciously intellectual” and “able to quote Jefferson at the drop of a dime”.She went on to describe the United States as rooted in dualities – “the good and bad, America is the hope and despair”.After her remarks, she joined a chorus in singing Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land”, then elicited a few squeals from onlookers when she waved before slipping out a back door.As the crowd departed, Paul Weidorn, 63, a high school teacher who lives in Severna Park, said he was impressed by her words and passion.But he said Ms Ocasio-Cortez needs more than just heated rhetoric.“It all sounds great, but how do you turn it into something that happens?” he asked. “When you get down to the nuts and bolts, how do you turn it into legislation?”Washington PostOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

"All drones belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz have returned to their bases," said a spokesman for the Iranian armed forcesAn MQ-9 Reaper drone flies a combat mission. (Photo: Lt. Col. Leslie Pratt/U.S. Air Force)Iran on Friday said President Donald Trump's claim that the American Navy shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz is "delusional" and suggested the U.S. may have accidentally destroyed its own aircraft."We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else," Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, tweeted Friday. "I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own [unmanned aircraft system] by mistake!"We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!— Seyed Abbas Araghchi (@araghchi) July 19, 2019Araghchi's tweet comes just hours after Trump said in remarks at the White House that the U.S. Navy "immediately destroyed" an unmanned drone that flew within 1,000 yards of an American warship. CNN reported that the drone was downed with "electronic jamming.""This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters," Trump said, without presenting any evidence to support the accusation. "The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities, and interests, and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce."Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, who is in New York on a visit to the United Nations headquarters, told reporters, "We have no information about losing a drone."Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesman for the Iranian Armed Forces, said the U.S. president's claim that the American Navy downed an Iranian drone is completely false."Unlike Trump's delusional and groundless claim," said Shekarchi, "all drones belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, including the one mentioned by the U.S. president, have returned to their bases safe and sound after carrying out their scheduled surveillance and control operations."Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, spokesman of the Iranian parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, said Trump's claim is part of an effort by the U.S. to "create tensions and psychological warfare in the region and in Iran, and hide its failures.""Trump's claim is not endorsed by anyone," Hosseini added, "because it is not true."Trump delivered his remarks just hours after Iran said it seized a foreign vessel in the Persian Gulf that was smuggling Iranian fuel. The seizure of the ship came two weeks after British commandos detained an Iranian supertanker that it said was carrying oil to Syria in violation of E.U. sanctions.As Common Dreams reported at the time, Iran accused the U.K. of an act of "maritime piracy" and said British forces were acting on behalf of the Trump administration.Last month, Iran downed an unmanned U.S. spy drone that it said violated Iranian airspace. The incident led Trump to approve airstrikes on Iranian targets before calling them off at the last minute.In a statement following Trump's claim on Thursday, Paul Kawika Martin, senior director for policy and political affairs at Peace Action, said White House policies are responsible for "the high tensions in the Strait of Hormuz.""Because of the Trump administration's policy of maximum provocation towards Iran, America stands on the precipice of another blunderous war of choice in the Middle East," said Martin.

By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline and Wires  Published: 15:51 EDT, 18 July 2019  |  Updated: 05:19 EDT, 19 July 2019   1.8kView  commentsIran has accused the US of taking out one of its own drones by mistake after Donald Trump said the Navy had destroyed an unmanned craft over the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran's deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi flatly denied reports that any of its drones had been destroyed, either 'in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else'.'I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) by mistake!' he tweeted on Friday.It comes after the president announced that an Iranian drone making 'provocative and hostile' maneuvres had been destroyed on Thursday, in what the Defense Department later said was an electronic warfare attack.  Iran's deputy defence minister Seyed Araghchi (right) denied that the US had brought down one of its drones Friday, after President Trump (left) said one was destroyed ThursdayAraghchi then goaded the US, suggesting that it may have shot down one of its own UAS - which stands for unmanned aerial systems - by mistakeTrump had said that the USS Boxer, a helicopter assault ship (pictured on July 17), had taken out the 'provocative and hostile' drone while sailing through the Strait of Hormuz on ThursdayA drone-killer buggy parked on the deck of the Boxer (pictured right) is believed to have knocked the craft out of the skies by cutting the signal to its control towerThe Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, and then to the open ocean; about one-fifth of the oil on the world's markets is shipped through itHe said the drone was downed as the Boxer passed through the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic bottleneck through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day, and which sits partially in Iranian waters.  The president called the incident 'the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters.' Iranian armed forces spokesman Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi also denied the claims Friday, saying: 'Despite Trump's baseless and delusional claims, all of (Iran's) drones... have safely returned to their bases.'There have been no reports of a confrontation with the American USS Boxer.'Iran's military recently shot down a U.S. drone that it said was flying in Iranian airspace, firing a strike with a surface-to-air missile. President Trump called off a planned airstrike at the last moment, saying later that retaliating would have killed approximately 150 people on the ground. Trump made his announcement Thursday at the beginning of a White House ceremony to mark the return of an American flag that flew from the stern of an American ship in the D-Day invasion.An hour earlier he had told reporters at the end of a pohto-op with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte that 'a big event just happened in Iran. A big event.'The drone was downed in international waters, according to a Pentagon official.The increased use of drones by Iran and its allies for surveillance and attacks across the Middle East is raising alarms in Washington, according to a Reuters report this week.The Pentagon said the Boxer (pictured) was in international waters passing through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf when it launched its attack Trump said the Boxer took action after what he called 'provocative and hostile' maneuvres by the Iranian droneIran is known to fly several drone missions over the Strait of Hormuz each day as part of its efforts to monitor traffic through the bottleneck (USS Boxer, pictured July 17)U.S. Marines inspect an AV-8B Harrier aircraft on the flight deck of USS BoxerA CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter takes off from the deck of the USS Boxer on July 17The U.S. believes Iran-linked militias in Iraq have recently increased their surveillance of American troops and bases in the country by using off-the-shelf, commercially available drones.The disclosure comes at a time of heightened tensions with Iran and underscores the many ways in which Tehran and the forces it backs are increasingly relying on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in places like Yemen, Syria, the Strait of Hormuz and Iraq.Beyond surveillance, Iranian drones can drop munitions and even carry out 'a kamikaze flight where they load it up with explosives and fly it into something', according to a U.S. official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.Iran now flies two or three drones over Gulf waters every day, the U.S. official estimated, making it a core part of Tehran's effort to monitor the Strait of Hormuz.Wasp-class ships, such as the Boxer, are designed to be capable of landing an entire Marine Expeditionary Unit via helicopter and then provide air support with Harrier jetsThe Boxer was moved into the Persian Gulf amid heightened tensions with Iran, that saw Tehran shoot down an American drone last monthA member of the Wasp's crew inspects a radar screen on the bridgeTrump announced the military action at the beginning of a ceremony to mark the return of a Dutch-owned 48-star American flag that flew on a Navy ship on D-Day The United States and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of carrying out attacks against six oil tankers near the Strait in the past two months, a claim Tehran has denied.'We have seen an uptick in drone activity in Iraq near our bases and facilities,' the official said. 'Certainly the drones that we have seen are more of the commercial off-the-shelf variant. So they're obviously a deniable type UAV-activity in Iraq.''I want to apprise everyone of an incident in the Strait of Hormuz today, involving USS Boxer, a navy amphibious assault ship. 'The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone, which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down, and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. 'This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, our facilities and interests, and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce. 'I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the strait and to work with us in the future. 'Thank you very much. I thought you should know that.' In recent weeks, mortars and rockets have been fired at bases in Iraq where U.S. forces are located but no American troops have been injured. Iraqi militia groups linked to Iran began using drones in 2014 and 2015 in battles to retake territory from ISIS.These groups received training on the use of drones from members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah, according to Iraqi security officials with knowledge of militia activities.'Key militia groups have the ability to launch aerial attacks using drones. Will they target American interests? That hasn't happened yet,' said one Iraqi security official. 'They used Katyusha and mortars in very restricted attacks against American interests in Iraq to send a message rather than trying to inflict damage. Using explosive-laden drones is very possible once we have a worsening situation between Tehran and Washington.'In March, Iran boasted about a complex military exercise involving 50 drones. In a slickly edited video aired on state TV, waves of drones streak across a clear blue sky, bombing buildings on an island in the Gulf.The show of force was intended to highlight Iran's locally developed UAV program, which it has been building up for several years.U.S. forces shot down Iranian-made drones in 2017 in Syria, after deeming them a threat to both U.S.-backed forces and their advisers.A U.S. Navy officer uses binoculars to follow movements of other ships near the USS Boxer

Desktop notifications are on   | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from  The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications?Just minutes after Stephen Colbert kicked off his show Thursday night, the late-night host took a moment to deliver a timely public service announcement.“In light of recent rallies, I would like you to enjoy tonight’s gathering, but I encourage you to please chant responsibly,” he said, staring into the camera with mock seriousness.The advisory, Colbert clarified, stemmed from one event in particular — a rally President Trump hosted in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday night during which his supporters debuted a new chant[How a racist tweet became a Trump rally chant in three short days]For 13 seconds, the collective voices of thousands shouted “Send her back!,” directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a Somali-born refugee who became a U.S. citizen at the age of 17. The chant echoed widely condemned racist comments made by Trump earlier this week about Omar and three other minority congresswomen. On Thursday, the president attempted to distance himself from the words yelled at the rally and falsely insisted that he tried to quell the cries, telling reporters he “felt a little bit badly about it.”“Sometimes I think this guy thinks cameras don’t exist,” Comedy Central host Trevor Noah said of Trump on Thursday night. “He didn’t stop anything. He was basking in that moment like an iguana soaking up racist sun.”[Trump says he disagrees with ‘Send her back!’ chant directed at Rep. Omar during his rally despite his previous ‘go back’ tweet]As the country grapples with Trump’s attacks against the four congresswomen, late-night hosts — all frequent critics of the president — have added their voices to the fray. On Thursday, their reactions to the rally chant and Trump’s defense ranged from disbelief to outrage.“Wow,” Noah remarked after playing a video of the chant on his show."It almost makes you miss the innocent days when all Trump’s crowd wanted to do was imprison a woman without trial,” he said, referencing the “Lock her up!” chant that regularly targeted Hillary Clinton at Trump rallies in 2016. “That was horrible, but at least Hillary would get to stay in the country.”Trump supporters chanting “send her back” about Ilhan Omar almost makes you miss the days when all they wanted was to imprison a woman without trial. pic.twitter.com/3JfI9kykeoOn NBC, Seth Meyers condemned Wednesday’s rallying call as “truly horrific.”“This is one of the most vile spectacles in modern political history,” he said.As the crowd shouted, the host pointed out that Trump “just stood by.” Footage of the moment showed the president appearing to take in the chant, turning his head left and right as he stood onstage behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal.“That’s not how you stop a chant. That’s how you wait in line at the deli for them to call your number,” Meyers quipped before adopting a bored expression and slowly swiveling his head from side to side.Noah joked that Trump “let that chant go on for so long Usain Bolt could have won a gold medal in that time.” The host then played a video of the Jamaican sprinter racing in the 100-meter dash alongside the rally clip.“You see that?” Noah said. “Everyone crossed the line before Trump stopped the chant.”Trump’s attempts to disavow his supporters’ actions also didn’t hold water with Colbert. The CBS host told his audience that the crowd at the event “did a bad thing,” only it was “exactly what [Trump] wanted.”Colbert drew attention to Trump’s comments at the rally, highlighting the moment the president suggested the four minority lawmakers should leave the country. “If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it,” Trump said at one point.“Let’s see if the crowd is able to pick up on that subtle messaging,” Colbert said.Like Noah and Meyers, Colbert didn’t hesitate to point out the inconsistencies between Trump’s actions and his words.“Wow, Trump supporters did you see him throw you under the bus?” Colbert said after playing video of the president telling reporters that he was “not happy with” the chant and disagreed with it. “Probably not since you have a tire on your face right now.”Then Colbert called on Trump to “take responsibility for what [he] inspired.”“You created that crowd,” he said. “You’re like Dr. Frankenstein saying, ‘I didn’t strangle those villagers. It was my monster. All I did was sew together some dead bodies, zap it with lightning, deny it love, set it loose and mention that I knew some people who could use a good strangling.’” Sign up for email updates from the "Confronting the Caliphate" series.

Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJapanese police have named the man suspected of carrying out a deadly arson attack on an animation studio.Shinji Aoba is in police custody in hospital and is being treated for burns before he can be questioned.The fire swept through Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) on Thursday, claiming at least 33 lives and injuring many in one of Japan's worst mass killings in years.People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Police say the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouted: "Die!" In the wake of the attack, dozens of people have gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers.A crowdfunding campaign has also raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels, and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building.The BBC's Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station appears to show him filling up two containers with petrol shortly before the incident.Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. However, he is still recovering from injuries in hospital and has not been formally interviewed about his motive.Public broadcaster NHK reports that he has a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store.Kyoto Animation's president has said he recently received threatening letters, but has no idea if they were connected to the attack. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from."It was like I was looking at hell," a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Around 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Kyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was likely made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have "[acted] as a chimney.""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb," Mr Higuchi added.The fire has since been put out, and police are searching the site for evidence in their investigation. Knives have also reportedly been found at the scene.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, has postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market.It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff.It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.The supreme court says peacekeeping soldiers from the Netherlands are partly to blame for 350 killings.15 sayings from around the world

    a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.“Thankfully our politics has not gone down the same road as parts of Europe and the US, but we must act now to stop sliding into nationalism.”Mr Javid praised Nigel Farage for leaving Ukip when Tommy Robinson was appointed as an adviser, saying the party's support has “collapsed” because of its lurch to the right.He urged people not to label the Brexit Party extremists or “demonise anyone with a different view”, amid mounting polarisation in political debate.Mr Javid delivered his speech at an event in central London organised by the Commission for Countering Extremism, which published research on Friday finding that far-right protests are attracting the largest numbers since the 1930s in Britain.The home secretary, who is expected to retain a cabinet post under the next prime minister, stopped short of labelling Donald Trump a racist but heavily criticised the US president's calls for ethnic minority American Congresswomen to “go back” to other countries.“I am deeply concerned about the polarisation we're seeing in parts of the US, some of the naked populism we see and chants of 'send her back',” Mr Javid said, pledging that the UK would be a “critical friend” to American allies.Mr Javid called on all public figures to “moderate their language” but refused to criticise Boris Johnson when The Independent highlighted his comments comparing Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers.“It's incumbent on all politicians to be careful about the language they use,” the home secretary said, before reiterating his support for Mr Johnson in the Conservative leadership race.“He is someone who is passionately anti-extremist and passionately anti-racist, and embraces modern Britain,” he added.Mr Javid insisted that the Conservative Party would root out anti-Muslim hatred in its own ranks and defended the government's decision not to adopt a proposed definition of Islamophobia.He accused the Labour Party of failing to address antisemitism and claimed that Jeremy Corbyn's office had threatened to sue him amid a Twitter furore over a post from one of Mr Corbyn's supporters.The Independent understands that Mr Javid was sent a legal letter and issued a clarification, after which no further action was taken by Labour.The home secretary said the government's 2015 counter-extremism strategy had focused on Islamists, and it was “time to take stock and talk openly about the threat and admit it's got worse”.“The faultlines dividing our society have splintered and spread,” he said, saying far-right extremism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and religious intolerance were all on the rise.“We all have a role to play to stop the normalisation and legitimisation of these views.”Mr Javid said he had barred several extremists, including the leader of white nationalist group Generation Identity, from entering the UK and would continue stripping British citizenship from dual national Isis members in Syria.He said the controversial campaign group Cage, whose research director described Jihadi John a “beautiful young man” would be stripped of its right to sponsor migrant workers.Outlining a series of proposals to improve integration, Mr Javid said he would request more money for English langauge lessons and balance out ethnic segregation in primary schools.“We must not be afraid to confront these issues and be open and honest in public debate,” he added.The government is to consider full recommendations from the Commission for Countering Extremism in September, following nationwide research on people's views and experiences.A survey found more than half of respondents had witnessed extremism online or in person.Sara Khan, the lead commissioner, said people must retain the “right to be radical” and offensive.“We need to start talking about what we stand for as a country, and what we are defending,” she added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxRegister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Enter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the

Philippines police filed charges of cyber libel and sedition against three dozen of President Rodrigo Duterte's political opponents over a series of YouTube videos in the recent elections accusing the controversial leader and his family of links to the illicit drugs trade.The Filipino justice department is now investigating the criminal complaint against 36 individuals, Reuters reported, including Duterte's rivals in the Senate and the Catholic Church, who are accused of conspiring with a fake whistleblower to lie about the president.At the center of the anonymous videos is a hooded man known as "Bikoy" who says he worked for a drugs gang connected to Duterte's family. A man has since come forward to police claiming to be Bikoy and alleging that Duterte's opponents orchestrated the whole thing."The filing of cases against key members of the opposition are clear acts of political persecution and harassment by the Duterte administration meant to stifle democratic dissent," Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, one of those facing charges over the videos, said in a statement.Trillanes accused police investigators of having "clearly abused and misused the subpoena power recently bestowed on them to single out critics of the Duterte administration."The accused deny any involvement with the videos. The reliability of the witness claiming to be Bikoy, Peter Joemel Advincula, is in question. He has a conviction for fraud and has made contradictory actions and statements, according to Inquirer.Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs has seen thousands of extrajudicial killings, and is now the subject of a U.N. human rights investigation, denies allegations that he or his family have financial ties to the narcotics industry he is infamous for fighting against.The videos claimed drug money was funneled to his family's bank accounts, including one belonging to Duterte's son, Paolo Duterte, a former vice mayor of Davao City and now a member of the House of Representatives.The Filipino leader is highly popular among voters and his PDP-Laban party commands a supermajority in the country's parliament. Yet, despite his firm grip on power, he has often targeted political opponents with vicious rhetoric and threats of detention.Duterte's spokesman, Salvador Panelo, distanced the leader from the charges. "We have nothing to do with this case. None at all. Absolutely nothing," Panelo told ABS-CBN, saying justice will now take its course. "My attitude there is it's about time to know the truth about this video."According to PhilStar, a document attached the criminal complaint, which is not yet public, says the witness claims he was "was engaged by the respondents to spread lies against the president, his family and close associate, making them to appear as illegal drug trade protectors and how they earned staggering amounts of money."© 2019 Newsweek

Maybe there’s still hope for humanity.Amid a news cycle dominated by stories of the president telling congresswomen of color to “go back” to where they came from, it’s difficult to think of how such ingrained racism can be undone. But a thread on Twitter documenting a particularly effective clap back to a man’s racist comment is giving people hope. Author Jaime Primak shared the story on Tuesday of a man who asked her to stop speaking Spanish on an early morning flight. But the incident didn’t spiral downward. Instead, the flight attendant and another man seated next to the racist passenger started speaking Spanish.This man just asked me to “please stop speaking Spanish” on this plane to NYC (in his defense it’s very early and he’s racist) so the man next to him STARTED SPEAKING SPANISH and then the flight attendant and my GOD i have never wanted to get up and dance more than i do now.It’s not clear which airline the incident took place on, and Primak did not immediately respond to the Daily Dot’s request for an interview.People’s responses to her tweet are wholesome, a reminder that we’re not as alone as we think when a random white person tries to shut us up for speaking our native language. Many said they would have started speaking Spanish—even though they’re not fluent—just to piss off the guy.I don't even speak Spanish and I would have gone at it just to annoy this guyEmbarrassingly, I only know a small amount of medical Spanish, but I’d like to think I would have participated by using it to ask him how long he had this problem in his mouth and how many times a day.I can’t speak Spanish but would probably have started swearing at him in a variety of other languages. I had a rather international upbringing & can swear in French, Dutch, German, Arabic, Turkish & Hong Kong Chinese (had a Chinese roommate at school)Oh I so wish I had been there (I speak Spanish and I am Scottish with a very Scottish accent in English - WE COULD HAVE FUCKED WITH HIS HEAD)Some shared their own experiences with being told by strangers to stop speaking their native language.Hahaha! I did the same thing. Was on Costco line and this guy asked to me stop speaking my mother tongue to my parent (they were on the phone w/ me in another country). This lady in front me rolled her eyes and started cursing at the guy in German. Danke Schön!I once had a racist ask me the same thing, so I switched to French and told him, “Je suis désolé que vous soyez stupide et que vous ne parlez qu'une seule langue.”Incidents like these are far too common. Midtown lawyer Aaron Schlossberg was entirely canceled for threatening to call ICE on two women for speaking Spanish, and a white woman was chased out of a grocery store by another white woman who asked two shoppers not to speak Spanish.On Twitter, some said they’ve planned their own clapbacks in case something similar happens to hem.I keep waiting for this to happen to me. I’m the child of immigrants and though I was born here, English wasn’t my first language. I speak with my grandma in her native tongue and I’m loud. Come at me.Bold of you to assume they can tell the difference.Let me go ahead and open up my @duolingo and practice this espanol!I would instantly start chanting “Donde esta el banyo, por favor?” and then block his path to the bathroom because that’s the most important phrase you can know in Spanish.It’s been a rough week for immigrants, people of color, and probably anyone who speaks a native language other than English. A crowd chanted “Send her back!” at President Donald Trump’s rally on Wednesday amid his continued racist attacks on congresswomen. But Primak’s thread, including others’ responses, is reason enough to hope that more and more bystanders are ready to fight back.READ MORE:Got five minutes? We’d love to hear from you.

This is why we have suggested several alternative methods that may help you go around direct decryption and try to restore your files. Bear in mind that these methods may not be 100% effective but may also help you a little or a lot in different situations.Method 1: Scanning your drive’s sectors by using Data Recovery software. Another method for restoring your files is by trying to bring back your files via data recovery software. Here are some suggestions for preferred data recovery software solutions:Method 2: Trying Kaspersky and EmsiSoft’s decryptors. If the first method does not work, we suggest trying to use decryptors for other ransomware viruses, in case your virus is a variant of them. The two primary developers of decryptors are Kaspersky and EmsiSoft, links to which we have provided below:Method 3: Using Shadow ExplorerTo restore your data in case you have backup set up, it is important to check for Volume Shadow Copies, if ransomware has not deleted them, in Windows using the below software:Shadow ExplorerMethod 4: Finding the decryption key while the cryptovirus sends it over a network via a sniffing tool.Another way to decrypt the files is by using a Network Sniffer to get the encryption key, while files are encrypted on your system. A Network Sniffer is a program and/or device monitoring data traveling over a network, such as its internet traffic and internet packets. If you have a sniffer set before the attack happened you might get information about the decryption key.

Another way is by clicking on All Files and Folders.<img src="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/search-companion.jpg" alt="search companion" width="289" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14957" srcset="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/search-companion.jpg 289w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/search-companion-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" />3: After that type the name of the file you are looking for and click on the Search button. This might take some time after which results will appear. If you have found the malicious file, you may copy or open its location by right-clicking on it.Now you should be able to discover any file on Windows as long as it is on your hard drive and is not concealed via special software.Step 4: Scan for with SpyHunter Anti-Malware Tool<img src="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Update-1.png" alt="SpyHunter5-update-2018" width="625" height="262" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52463" srcset="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Update-1.png 625w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Update-1-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><img src="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3.png" alt="SpyHunter5-Free-Scan-2018" width="1125" height="834" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52464" srcset="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3.png 1125w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3-300x222.png 300w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3-768x569.png 768w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3-1024x759.png 1024w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-3-956x709.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /><img src="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4.png" alt="SpyHunter-5-Free-Scan-Next-2018" width="1122" height="812" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52462" srcset="https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4.png 1122w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4-300x217.png 300w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4-768x556.png 768w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4-1024x741.png 1024w, https://sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SpyHunter-Install-And-Free-Scan-4-956x692.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" />Ventsislav has been covering the latest malware, software and newest tech developments at SensorsTechForum for 3 years now.

Lorenzo Gobbo took a piece of track through his lung at the U23 European Track Championships.On Friday, Italian cyclist Lorenzo Gobbo, 17, crashed at the the Junior and U23 European Track Championships at the Eddy Merckx Velodrome in Ghent, Belgium, and was pierced by a large wooden splinter during a scratch race, as the BBC reported.The freak accident occurred as a result of a rider’s pedal striking the track during the crash, causing the massive piece of wood to break off. The splinter entered the left side of Gobbo’s back, piercing through his lung, and coming out the other side of his abdomen and into his thigh, according to the report.Calling it a “splinter,” though, doesn’t quite do it justice—the piece of wood was half a meter long, or roughly 20 inches, and it looked more like the rider had just lost a jousting match. Incredible quello che è successo ieri in pista a Gand per #LorenzoGobbo che caduto assieme ad altri è stato trafitto da un listello di legno staccato dalla pista. Ricoverato in ospedale ed operato dovrà starci per circa 15 giorni. Buona guarigione #amoilciclismo pic.twitter.com/CAnFZhzWedGobbo was rushed to Jan Palfijn hospital, where he spent three hours in surgery to extract the wood. On Tuesday, doctors needed to drain Gobbo’s lung. And as of yesterday, according to Tuttobiciweb, Gobbo remains in the hospital. However, he appears to be on the mend—the outlet reported that doctors expect him to make a full recovery. Gobbo said it has been easier for him to breathe, and he even managed to get out of bed and walk a bit on his own.

He could still laugh, but he doesn’t want to ride on the track for the time being,” Glorieux said. “He will have to find his courage. He should recover completely, but there is a long recovery time ahead for him.”

    Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed U.S. CBP after a report of a secret Facebook group that made fun of dead migrants.
    USA TODAYWASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group. The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border. He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the "disturbing" and "inexcusable" posts."Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?" Ocasio-Cortez asked McAleenan. "Yes," he answered. "And I directed an investigation within reading the article.""Did you see the images of officers circulating photoshop images of my violent rape?" Ocasio-Cortez continued. "Yes I did," McAleenan responded. 'A kennel for dogs':  Lawmakers hammer acting DHS chief Kevin McAleenan over migrant detention facilitiesA link has been posted to your Facebook feed. McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez questioned whether they were still "responsible for the safety of migrant women and children."He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying "I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more." McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a "dehumanizing culture" within Customs and Border Protection. "We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP," he said touting that the agency, "rescues 4,000 people a year" and is "committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with." He said the posts were "unacceptable" but "I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts." The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies. 
    President Trump says he "felt a little bit badly" about the chants of "send her back" that erupted at his North Carolina rally.
    USA TODAYIt started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should "go back" to where they came from. The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week. He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting "send her back" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, "I disagree with it" and "I wasn't happy with that message." 


WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today declared the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).“It is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,” said Dr. Tedros. “Extraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders -- coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities -- to shoulder more of the burden.”The declaration followed a meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee for EVD in the DRC. The Committee cited recent developments in the outbreak in making its recommendation, including the first confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost two million people on the border with Rwanda, and the gateway to the rest of DRC and the world.This was the fourth meeting of the Emergency Committee since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. The Committee expressed disappointment about delays in funding which have constrained the response. They also reinforced the need to protect livelihoods of the people most affected by the outbreak by keeping transport routes and borders open. It is essential to avoid the punitive economic consequences of travel and trade restrictions on affected communities.“It is important that the world follows these recommendations. It is also crucial that states do not use the PHEIC as an excuse to impose trade or travel restrictions, which would have a negative impact on the response and on the lives and livelihoods of people in the region,” said Professor Robert Steffen, chair of the Emergency Committee.Since it was declared almost a year ago the outbreak has been classified as a level 3 emergency – the most serious – by WHO, triggering the highest level of mobilization from WHO. The UN has also recognized the seriousness of the emergency by activating the Humanitarian System-wide Scale-Up to support the Ebola response.In recommending a PHEIC the committee made specific recommendations related to this outbreak.“This is about mothers, fathers and children - too often entire families are stricken. At the heart of this are communities and individual tragedies,” said Dr. Tedros. “The PHEIC should not be used to stigmatize or penalize the very people who are most in need of our help.”Subscribe to the WHO newsletter →Media Contacts Margaret Harris

One troy ounce reaches $1,452.60 amid increased US-Iran tensions
Jasper Jolly

Gold prices have hit their highest levels in six years as investors brace for an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and seek a safe haven amid tensions between Washington and Tehran.The price of one troy ounce of gold peaked at $1,452.60 on Friday morning, the highest point since May 2013, with fears over the Persian Gulf standoff also driving up the price of a commodity that is viewed as a market refuge during geopolitical crises.Gold prices have been boosted by the fall in bond yields – or the interest rate paid out by bond issuers – which move inversely to their prices. Many of the safest sovereign bonds are now negative-yielding, meaning that investors are effectively paying for the privilege of lending money to borrowers, with the upshot that gold is more attractive.Investors also tend to buy gold, which has relatively little practical value and yields no income, in times of geopolitical uncertainty. Iran on Friday denied that a US warship shot down one of its drones in the strait of Hormuz, contradicting the US president, Donald Trump.The decline in bond yields around the world has been the “most important driver” in gold’s price rises, said Oliver Jones, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, a London consultancy.Yields have fallen as investors prepare for the Federal Reserve, led by the chairman, Jerome Powell, to cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than a decade, during the financial crisis.The bets made by investors imply there is a 100% chance that the US central bank will ease monetary policy, according to CME Group. There is more than a 50% implied probability that Powell could announce a cut of 0.5 percentage points – more than the 0.25-point increment usually chosen.The US has enjoyed a decade of uninterrupted growth and the latest GDP figures showed that the world’s largest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first quarter. However, concerns are building that the recovery will slow sharply.“The key thing that the Fed is worried about is the weakness of the rest of the world spilling over to the US,” Jones said.At the same time, the increasing tensions between Iran and the US have added to nerves for some investors. The price of Brent crude oil futures rose by more than 1% on Friday to $63 per barrel after the report of the downed drone.Gold traders have also been boosted by the backing of Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, in a blogpost published on Wednesday.Dalio wrote: “I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold.”

BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) —  There will be no manholes in Berkeley, California. City workers will drop into "maintenance holes" instead.Nothing will be manmade in the liberal city but "human-made." And students at the University of California, Berkeley, will join "collegiate Greek system residences" rather than fraternities and sororities.Berkeley leaders voted unanimously this week to replace about 40 gender-specific words in the city code with gender-neutral terms — an effort to be more inclusive that's drawing both praise and scorn.That means "manpower" will become "human effort" or "workforce," while masculine and feminine pronouns like "she," ''her," ''he" and "him" will be replaced by "they" and "them," according to the measure approved Tuesday by the City Council.The San Francisco Bay Area city is known for its long history of progressive politics and "first of" ordinances. Berkeley was among the first cities to adopt curbside recycling in the 1970s and more recently, became the first in the U.S. to tax sugary drinks and ban natural gas in new homes.Berkeley also was the birthplace of the nation's free-speech movement in the 1960s and where protests from both left- and right-wing extremist groups devolved into violence during a flashpoint in the country's political divisions soon after President Donald Trump's election.Rigel Robinson, who graduated from UC Berkeley last year and at 23 is the youngest member of the City Council, said it was time to change a municipal code that makes it sound like "men are the only ones that exist in entire industries or that men are the only ones on city government.""As society and our cultures become more aware about issues of gender identity and gender expression, it's important that our laws reflect that," said Robinson, who co-authored the measure. "Women and non-binary people are just as deserving of accurate representation."When the changes take effect in the fall, all city forms will be updated and lists with the old words and their replacements will be posted at public libraries and the council chambers. The changes will cost taxpayers $600, Robinson said.Removing gendered terms has been slowly happening for decades in the United States as colleges, companies and organizations implement gender-neutral alternatives.California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, changed a Sacramento political tradition by adopting the unofficial title "first partner" instead of "first lady," saying it's more inclusive. The change reflected Siebel Newsom's experience as an actress and filmmaker focused on gender politics and inequality.But formalizing the shift in the sweeping way that Berkeley is doing is "remarkable and sends a message," Rutgers University linguistics professor Kristen Syrett said."Anytime you're talking about something where gender is not the issue but you use a gendered term, that immediately sends a message of exclusion, even if it's a dialogue that has nothing to do with gender," said Syrett, who recently spearheaded an update to the guidelines on inclusive language for the Linguistic Society of America.For Hel Baker, a Berkeley home caregiver, the shift is a small step in the right direction."Anything that dismantles inherent bias is a good thing, socially, in the grand scheme of things," the 27-year-old said."I don't, by any means, think this is the great championing for gender equality, but you gotta start somewhere," Hel added.Lauren Singh, 18, who grew up in Berkeley, approved of the move, saying, "Everyone deserves to be represented and feel included in the community."Not everyone agreed with the new ordinance. Laramie Crocker, a Berkeley carpenter, said the changes just made him laugh."If you try to change the laws every time someone has a new opinion about something, it doesn't make sense. It's just a bad habit to get into," Crocker said.Crocker, 54, said he would like city officials to focus on more pressing issues, like homelessness."Let's keep it simple, get back to work," he said. "Let's figure out how to get homeless people housed and fed. He, she, they, it — they're wasting my time."___Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.Copyright 2019 Associated Press.

WALTHAM, MA (WBZ/CNN) –  An investigation is underway in Massachusetts after a photo showing a dog on a moving tow truck flatbed drew outrage online.Michael Gerry said he was driving when he looked over and saw the dog. "My blood pressure went through the roof,” Gerry said. “It looked like a stuffed animal, so I got up a little closer and really got a good look at it."He took a picture, then tried to get the driver’s attention before calling police.He also tried to follow the truck but eventually lost it. So, he decided to post the photo on Facebook.Outraged animal lovers posted complaints to the Facebook page of Ramsay’s Towing, the company that owns the truck.The company in turn posted a statement saying they fired the driver over the incident.WBZ reports that people who worked at Ramsay’s Towing said the driver takes his dog to work sometimes, but for this tow some people needed a ride, which is why the dog rode in the back.Gerry told WBZ that although the dog was leashed, “There was enough slack on that leash that that dog could have easily fallen off the side and been caught up in the tire and [the driver] would have never known."Police said the dog is with its owner and is said to be fine.Massachusetts State Police and the Animal Rescue League of Boston are investigating the incident.Copyright 2019 WBZ via CNN.

WASHINGTON — Democrats on the House committees set to hear testimony next week from former special counsel Robert Mueller believe the hearings will help Americans understand "the gravity of the president's misconduct," staff members told reporters."It is not that that there will be a big, dramatic, new revelation necessarily, we're not expecting that," a Judiciary Committee Democratic staffer said Thursday in a briefing ahead of the hearings. "What's important is there is truly shocking evidence of criminal misconduct by the president — not once but again and again and again — that would result in any other American being criminally charged in a multiple count indictment."The committees are anticipating that "not everybody is reading the book (Mueller's report) but people will watch the movie," an aide said.Mueller is expected to appear publicly on Wednesday for three hours before the Judiciary Committee followed by roughly two hours before the House Intelligence Committee.During his public statement in May after the report was complete, Mueller said, "The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress."But both committees want to dig into Mueller's evidence, not necessarily the conclusions — or lack thereof — laid out in his report. Democratic staffers believe the former special counsel will "lean into" the factual findings that his team made."Our focus is really going to be to have the special counsel talk about what the evidence is that he found, less about what the legal conclusion was, because some of the actual evidence is very concerning and has not received the attention it's due," an Intelligence Committee staffer said.Mueller's report did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its interference in the 2016 election.On obstruction of justice, Mueller left it to Attorney General William Barr to choose whether to bring obstruction charges against the president; Barr declined to do so, he told Congress, based on the evidence presented and Department of Justice guidelines around prosecuting a sitting president.The Mueller report makes it clear that Trump was not exonerated but it simply found insufficient criminal evidence to prosecute.The Judiciary Committee hopes to show that if any other American had engaged in the same conduct as Trump did as detailed in the 400-plus page Mueller report, they would be charged for obstruction of justice.Democratic lawmakers plan to highlight at least five instances they believe clearly show Trump committed a crime, the staffers said.Democrats on the Judiciary Committee will highlight these actions by Trump as detailed in the report: Repeatedly directing his then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller; telling McGahn to deny that he had been ordered to fire Mueller; asking former campaign manager Cory Lewandowski to deliver a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the investigation to exclude the president; telling Lewandowski to let Sessions know that he's fired if he doesn't meet with Lewandowski; and potential witness tampering with Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen."Mr. McGahn is very much on our mind as you'll also see at the hearing," a staffer said.Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, for their part, believe the public has a "slanted" view of the Mueller report and plan to highlight interactions between the Trump campaign and Russia and WikiLeaks, including that the report indicates that Trump himself knew that Wikileaks possessed emails damaging to Hillary Clinton before they were released to the public and then touted Wikileaks during the campaign.Republicans stress that the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion or obstruction and hope Democrats will move on after hearings next week."I hope the special counsel's testimony marks an end to the political gamesmanship that Judiciary Democrats have pursued at great cost to taxpayers," Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., said in a statement. "May this testimony bring to House Democrats the closure that the rest of America has enjoyed for months, and may it enable them to return to the business of legislating."Mueller was originally set to testify last Wednesday but was delayed a week to accommodate additional time for more committee members to ask questions, a move praised by both Democrats and Republicans.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are still working out how to best utilize the three hours so that all 41 members are able to ask questions."We have never prepared for one the way that we have prepared for this," one staffer said about the highly anticipated hearing, noting that Mueller likes to give short answers to questions so the committees are taking that into account as they prepare.Neither Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler nor Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff have spoken to Mueller ahead of the hearings next week, staffers said.There are still ongoing discussions with the House Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice to allow some of Mueller's deputies to appear in a closed classified session so they can discuss some information that cannot be revealed publicly, such as portions of the redacted report or underlying evidence."This just seems to be another effort by the Attorney General to limit the amount of information coming out of the special counsel's office in order to protect the president," an Democratic Intelligence staffer said.A growing number of Democrats — nearly 90 in the House — are pushing for starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump, which the House Judiciary Committee would hold jurisdiction over, but staffers point out that hearings and fact-finding investigations are usually conducted before considering articles of impeachment."This is the first obviously substantive hearing where Mr. Mueller is going to be able to give a firsthand account of what witnesses told him. The next phase, obviously, is to get the actual witnesses," a Judiciary staffer said.Alex Moe is a Capitol Hill producer for NBC News covering the House of Representatives. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL


DENVER - A plea deal has left a Denver rape victim feeling victimized twice, first by her attacker, then by the judge, according to KDVR.Denver District Court Judge John Madden sentenced Jared Bates to 45 days in jail last Friday after the 29-year old man agreed to plead guilty to attempted sexual assault.But since Bates had already served 47 days after his initial arrest, the judge released him for time served."I want women to know his face, I want them to know his (Bates') name. I want them to know the judge's name, I want them to know that he (Madden) decided how this was going to go," said Maria Crow.The 31-year-old was drinking with Bates in her apartment on June 23, 2018 when she blacked out. Her brother Michael Crow walked in and said he saw his sister lying unconscious with Bates standing over her with a knife."I saw my best friend Jared Bates standing over my sister and he was putting his private parts back into his pants, zipping up his pants," Michael Crow said.Michael Crow said he realized immediately his sister had been raped while she was passed out."She wasn't breathing. That really freaked me out and so I called the police," he said.Denver police arrested Bates within minutes and the district attorney charged him with six counts, including sexual assault of a helpless victim.Maria Crow felt her case was as strong as they get."I had DNA on my clothes. I had DNA on my face. I had residue all over my body. My pants were down... And my brother walking in and he was the witness to the crime," she said.But just before the trial, prosecutors struck a plea deal. Bates would plead guilty to attempted sexual assault and register as a sex offender.In an email to KDVR, a spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney's Office wrote, "Our office negotiated a plea agreement - that the victim approved - and which called for Jared Bates to serve up to three years in prison. At sentencing, we requested a three-year prison sentence."Instead, Madden gave Bates 45 days and 5 years probation.Investigative reporter Rob Low spoke to Bates at the front door of his apartment. Bates refused to answer as to whether he thought the sentence was too lenient and initially said he couldn't offer Maria Crow an apology but eventually did."If she were to listen to this, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry for anything and everything," said Bates, who said he was trying to move on with his life.Maria Crow's family says it hasn't been easy for them to move on, especially because of the judge's sentence."He shouldn't be a judge no more if he's going to give out sentences like this," said Michael Crow.Maria Crow, referring to Judge Madden said, "An explanation would be nice."She doesn't blame prosecutors but in hindsight wishes she had taken her chances with a jury at trial, where Bates would've faced more serious felonies."After hearing all the details of this case, I cannot see 12 people looking at me [and saying] I deserve something like this," Maria Crow said.On Thursday evening, Colorado Judicial Department spokesman Rob McCallum said that under the Judicial Code of Conduct, Madden is prohibited from discussing cases and rulings.Maria Crow's father tells the Problem Solvers he intends to start a recall effort against the judge.Filed in: News Topics: denver, sexual assault

“They chant some pretty bad stuff at a football game. Politics is a tough sport,” Jesse Watters said.First, there was “locker room talk.” Now we have “football game chants.”The morning after a Trump rally crowd broke out into a “Send Her Back!” chant aimed at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Wednesday night, the president’s favorite morning show brought on one of his favorite Fox hosts to spin the viciously racist and xenophobic moment.Taking a seat on Fox & Friends’ curvy couch in front of a live studio audience Thursday morning, Jesse Watters was asked by co-host Steve Doocy for his take on the rally. After bragging about the “record numbers” of the crowd and how there were “lines out around the block,” Watters claimed that Trump had to “create a contrast” with the so-called “Squad”—the group of Democratic congresswomen of color that the president has targeted with racist taunts—because they’re “hot” right now.“Were you surprised by that?” Brian Kilmeade asked.“No, I was not,” Watters replied. “I mean, they telegraphed it. It was like Kamala [Harris] swinging a punch at Joe [Biden], you could see that coming a mile away.”Adding that the president ran down the “wicked political rap sheet” of Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), the Watters’ World host groused that the media isn’t reporting on what Trump said about the Squad before brushing off the racist crowd chants that dominated news coverage of the event.“Now I don’t know about you guys, but have you guys ever been to a football game?” Watters said. “They chant some pretty bad stuff at a football game. Politics is a tough sport.”He continued: “Some Republicans chanted some things. Some Democrats framed Trump for treason. I think you guys see the difference.”The hosts, meanwhile, did not push back, instead playing another set of clips from Trump’s rally.Watters’ defense of the chant came hours after his The Five co-host Greg Gutfeld took issue with a pundit describing the chants as “pure mob insanity” led by the president. “Apparently, you’ve never been to a sporting event,” Gutfeld remarked.This new pro-Trump spin also comes on the heels of Fox & Friends weekend host Jedediah Bila laughing off the president’s racist tweets that kicked off this whole controversy, dismissing the racism of Trump’s remarks as having just been “very comedic.”And Watters’ excuse for the racist chants is curiously reminiscent of Trumpworld’s downplaying of the Access Hollywood tape, which featured Trump boasting that he could grab women “by the pussy.” At that time, Trump and his supporters quickly settled on describing his comments as merely “locker room talk.”Got a tip?

Press Play, Get SmarterReporterIf you were writing a list of things that are and are not racist, slavery should probably be pretty close to the top of the “are” section. But not for a Republican state lawmaker from New Hampshire, who claimed in a Facebook post that owning slaves was based on economics, not racism. State Rep. Werner Horn has deleted a Facebook post on the matter, but has repeated his opinion in multiple interviews since. Horn was responding to a post from state House member who asked: “If Trump is the most racist president in American history, what does that say about all of the other presidents who owned slaves?” Horn replied: “Wait, owning slaves doesn’t make you racist... owning slaves wasn’t a decision predicated on race but on economics. It’s a business decision.” He later told HuffPost: “[Slave owners] weren’t enslaving black people because they were black. They were bringing in these folks because they were available.”

1 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Merkel on Friday distanced herself from U.S. President Donald Trump’s comment that four minority Democratic congresswomen should “go back” to where they came from. Trump told four lawmakers - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came”. All four of them are U.S. citizens and three of them were born in the United States  “I decisively distance myself from that and I feel solidarity with the ... attacked women,” Merkel told a news conference.

Press Play, Get SmarterReporterThree children who are all U.S. citizens were held for several hours by Customs and Border Protection officers at a Chicago airport on Thursday morning in what activists say was a bid to lure their undocumented parents into custody, The Chicago Tribune reports. The children, ages 9, 10 and 13, were held at O'Hare International Airport after they returned from a trip to Mexico with a relative whom CBP officials deemed “inadmissible.” They reportedly told their mother officials wouldn't release them unless their undocumented parents picked them up. Their mother, Sylvia, was fearful she would be detained so she sent her son and daughter-in-law to pick them up, but they were turned away by officials. Sylvia then called the Mexican consulate, and an official was able to negotiate a deal where she could pick the children up without fear of being taken into custody herself. The relative was reportedly sent back to Mexico.CBP confirmed the children were stopped because the adult they were traveling with was not allowed to enter the U.S. and said the agency “attempted numerous times today to reach family members to pick up the children.” Activists reportedly protested the children’s detention at the airport, and lawmakers also spoke out about the issue. “I feel that it’s a kind of kidnapping of children by our government, and I’m really fed up with what we are doing,” Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) told the newspaper.


The process by which government regulators getting cozy with the businesses they’re supposed to regulate is a time-worn and familiar problem. There’s even a name for it — “regulatory capture.”But no government agency in our new gilded age seems to be plunging into this dishonorable relationship as gleefully as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau, it should be remembered, began as the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and was created as part of the financial reforms that followed the crash of 2008 and the recession that followed. The idea was to ride herd on a financial industry that thought nothing of ripping off consumers. That was how the CFPB functioned during the Obama administration.In the Trump administration the bureau seems more intent on helping financial firms pick consumers’ pockets. The latest case in point emerged Wednesday, when its director, Kathy Kraninger, told a conference of financial executives and lobbyists about a joint study the CFPB has completed with H&R Block, the tax preparation firm, about how to encourage consumers to save more. Kraninger’s remarks were reported by the Wall Street Journal. Block confirms that it “was able to partner with CFPB to study how taxpayers respond to savings encouraging messages,” but didn’t give any further details. The CFPB hasn’t responded to a request for comment.According to the Journal, Kraninger said the study focused on use of Block’s prepaid credit card “during tax-return season.” The report didn’t go into much more detail, but it’s proper to observe that Block systematically encourages its tax preparation customers to park their refunds on this card, which it promotes as an easy way to access your money. More on that in a moment.Kraninger said the study “showed positive results, which the bureau plans to unveil in the near future,” the Journal wrote.Let’s stipulate some ground rules. A consumer protection agency should not be performing a “joint study” with a regulated business, especially one aimed at promoting that business’ product. And double especially when that product falls within the jurisdiction of the agency, as prepaid cards do under the CFPB. Kraninger apparently didn’t say when the study with Block would be released or in what form, but any document that has both participants’ names on it will seem to at least some consumers as though the regulator is giving the regulated its imprimatur.That concern could only be intensified by Kraninger’s assertion at the meeting that the study “suggests simple timely marketing messages and small incentives help encourage consumers interested in ways to save during the tax time.” She also said that there’s “a fantastic opportunity for co-branding for engaging in the kind of studies” that show how to get people to save more. Co-branding by the CFPB and financial firms? Is that supposed to generate public confidence in the agency’s independence?This episode seems to be part and parcel of the dramatic remaking of the CFPB in the hands of Trump, who in February 2018 installed Mick Mulvaney, his director of the Office of Management and Budget, as the bureau’s acting director. Kraninger, who was a Mulvaney deputy at the OMB, took over in December.Mulvaney began his tenure with an open display of cocksure philistinism, taking potshots at Warren at a conference of appreciative credit union executives. “I am the acting director of the CFPB,” he said, “something that’s apparently keeping Elizabeth Warren up late at night, which doesn’t bother me at all.”It wasn’t just rhetoric. Mulvaney suspended a regulation, five years in the making, aimed at preventing payday lenders and other profiteers from low-income borrowers from lending to customers who can’t repay the loans, running up fees on customers, and engaging in other abuses. He abruptly withdrew, without explanation, a federal lawsuit against four allegedly abusive installment lenders. And he closed an investigation into World Acceptance Corp., a payday lender in his home state of South Carolina that had been accused of abusive practices, but had contributed at least $4,500 to Mulvaney’s congressional campaigns.In an email to CFPB staff, he drew a sharp distinction between his viewpoint and that of his Democratic predecessor, Richard Cordray, who took his job as a regulator seriously. In his talk to the financial executives, Mulvaney implied that Cordray had “abused” his authority by taking an overly aggressive stance on regulation.Kraninger has continued in this vein, as my colleague David Lazarus has assiduously documented. She has done so overtly — by proposing to roll back Obama administration rules governing the practices of payday lenders and other financial firms — and subtly — by placing consumer education in the forefront of the agency’s mission, ahead of regulation and enforcement. That shift in focus disconcerts consumer advocates, who are in favor of better financial education, but not at the expense of oversight.“Financial education isn’t going to stop a company from misapplying your mortgage payment or the wrongful repossession of a car,” observes Linda Jun, a senior policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform. “The financial crisis wasn’t about people suddenly forgetting how to save. That was a very minor aspect of what happened. There were these bad actors that preyed on people with deceptive fees and unfair practices and discrimination. The point of having a financial regulator that protects consumers is to bring these shady behaviors to an end.”That brings us to the question of whether H&R Block is an appropriate partner for the CFPB at any level. The firm, of course, is best known as an operator of storefront tax preparers and for its tax-preparation software. It will be recalled that Block and its chief competitor, Intuit — the maker of TurboTax software — were both sued in May by Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer for allegedly conniving to discourage millions of taxpayers from taking advantage of a free, simple online tax filing system provided by the Internal Revenue Service and steering them to their own (fee-based) services. The case is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court.What about Block’s prepaid credit card, a Mastercard dubbed the Emerald Card? Prepaid cards typically are peddled to lower-income customers who can’t obtain conventional credit cards. Conventional cards are unsecured, meaning that holders don’t have to put up collateral. Prepaid cards are linked to a bank account with a balance, which serves as the limit of the holder’s credit. When Block encourages customers to direct-deposit their refunds onto the card, it’s basically offering them credit up to the sum of their refunds plus any other money they have on deposit with Block. (The card is technically issued by Axos Bank, an internet bank headquartered in San Diego.)What does H&R Block get out of this? On the face of it, fees, and plenty of them. Block tells customers that the card has “no setup fee, no annual fee and no fee for purchases.” Mmm ... that’s not the whole story. According to the card’s fee schedule, holding the Emerald Card can run into money. For example, it will cost you up to $4.95 every time you reload your card balance at a retail store; if you reload by check, it will cost up to 4% of the check amount, with a minimum of $2. (If you deposit a $25 check to reload your card, that fee amounts to 8%. Just saying.)Using the card to make a withdrawal from an ATM: $3 each time, plus any fee that the ATM owner imposes. Withdrawing money from your card balance at a bank will cost you $35. Notwithstanding what Block says about no annual fee, there’s an “inactivity fee": If you haven’t used your card for 60 days, Block charges $4.95 per month. And if you lose your card or it’s stolen, a replacement will cost you $35, because as everybody knows, it costs the card issuer $35 to punch out a piece of plastic and put it in the mail.It’s conceivable that these fees are routine for prepaid credit cards. That’s not to excuse Block, but to point out that for many users prepaid cards are a costly convenience. The CFPB should be casting a gimlet eye on this financial product, including whether its fees are fair and fairly applied, not bragging that it’s partnered with a card issue on a study that has found unspecified benefits from a financial instrument bristling with fees that consumers may not all understand. Kraninger’s remarks signal that her agency is fine with the card. If that’s not so and the CFPB doesn’t wish to be associated with it, she needs to say so, now.As Jun notes, “H&R Block’s goals don’t seem to align with the CFPB’s.” At least, they didn’t used to.Sign up for our newslettersSubscribe for unlimited access


5 Min ReadTOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan’s foreign minister publicly admonished South Korea’s ambassador on Friday in a worsening dispute over compensation for Korean forced laborers that has spilled over into their trade in high-tech materials used to make memory chips and screens. The dispute between the key U.S. allies took a deadly turn when a South Korean man set himself on fire in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul in an apparent protest. He died later. South Korea accused Japan of violating international law with its curbs this month on the export of high-tech materials to South Korean chipmaking giants, which could disrupt global supply chains. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono summoned South Korea’s ambassador, Nam Gwan-pyo, a day after the expiry of Japan’s deadline for South Korea to accept third-country arbitration of the forced labor dispute. Ties been the neighbors have been thorny for decades because of South Korean resentment of Japan’s occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. The forced labor issue was thrust to centerstage last year when a South Korean court ordered two Japanese firms to pay compensation to Koreans forced to work for them. Japan says the whole compensation issue was settled under a 1965 treaty. Kono said South Korea had to take swift measures to correct what Japan calls an improper ruling by its Supreme Court ordering compensation. “What the South Korean government is doing now is equivalent to subverting the post-World War Two international order,” Kono said at the beginning of a meeting with Nam. Nam responded by saying South Korea was working every day to create an environment in which the lawsuits could be dealt with in a manner acceptable to both sides and not harm ties. Nam said South Korea had already proposed a plan to resolve the issue, but that drew a blunt interjection from Kono. “Hold on,” Kono said. “We’ve already told the South Korean side the South Korean proposal was totally unacceptable, and that is not something that would redress the situation where international law is violated. It is extremely impertinent to propose it again by pretending to not know that.” Neither official specified what that plan was, but last month Japan rejected a South Korean proposal to form a joint fund to compensate South Korean plaintiffs. Later, South Korea’s foreign ministry rejected Japan’s arbitration call as arbitrary and said Japan must remember its wrongs committed during colonial rule and try to heal the wound. An official of South Korea’s foreign ministry told Reuters it had expressed regret over Kono’s “rude” attitude.  Japan has denied that the compensation dispute is behind the export curbs even though one of its ministers cited broken trust with South Korea over the labor dispute in announcing the curbs. Japan has instead cited “inadequate management” of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media saying some items ended up in North Korea. South Korea denied that and responded by suggesting Japan had been lax in abiding by international sanctions against North Korea.  South Korea has called the export restrictions “unjust economic retaliation” and its deputy national security adviser accused Japan of violating international law by imposing them. “It is Japan that violated the WTO free trade regime and ... international law by taking measures that bring serious damage to global value chain by unilaterally imposing export curbs, when diplomatic efforts to resolve the forced labor issue had not been exhausted,” Kim Hyun-chong told a briefing. South Korea could not ignore its Supreme Court ruling ordering compensation, he said. Its trade ministry repeated calls for Japan to hold serious talks by July 24 over its export controls. Anger over wartime history can stir nationalistic feelings in both countries. A Seoul fire official said a 78-year-old man, surnamed Kim, drove up to the Japanese embassy early on Friday, stopped in front of the entrance and set fire to his car while in it. The man died in hospital, the official said. The man’s father-in-law was said to have been a victim of forced labor during World War Two and the man may have acted in protest against Japan’s export curbs, media said, citing police. Police declined to comment, saying they were investigating. Many South Koreans are boycotting Japanese products and services, from beer to clothes and travel, disrupting businesses already grappling with the worst economic conditions in a decade. South Korean trade official Lee Ho-hyeon said Japan’s plan to drop South Korea from its “white list” of countries with minimum trade restrictions would have major implications for global supply chains. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has sent letters to partners urging them to stockpile more Japanese components in case Tokyo widens its export curbs.

A man seen scaling the outside of a 19-story apartment building to escape a fire in Philadelphia on Thursday night made it to ground level unharmed.

Four residents and three police officers were injured, ABC Philadelphia station WPVI reported.
Fire crews are investigating the cause of the blaze, which began around 9:30 p.m. in the 4400 block of Holden Street.
The fire may have begun in a trash compactor, according to WPVI.

The building was evacuated, but several residents remain unaccounted for.

Her comments were revealed on the program Yahoo! News’ “Through Her Eyes” Opens a New Window. The heiress said she decided to conduct her own investigation after a distressed worker contacted her on Facebook.“Every single one of these people I talked to were saying, ‘I don’t know how I can maintain this face of joy and warmth when I have to go home and forage for food in other people’s garbage,’” she told Yahoo!Disney has shared with us the following statement in response to her comments:“We generally avoid commenting on such baseless reports like this, but this one is particularly egregious and we won’t let this stand.We strongly disagree with this characterization of our employees and their experience at Disney. This widely reported stunt is a gross and unfair exaggeration of the facts that is not only a misrepresentation but also an insult to the thousands of employees who are part of the Disney community. We continually strive to enhance the employment experience of our more than 200,000 employees through a variety of benefits and programs that provide them the opportunity, mobility and well-being.At our parks in Orlando and Anaheim, The Walt Disney Company currently pays its hourly workers an average of $19.50 an hour, significantly above the federal minimum wage. But we understand the challenges workers and families face in 2019 are complex and go beyond the paycheck. That’s why we provide a wide range of benefits and initiatives to improve our employees’ lives at and outside of work: from subsidized childcare to generous leave policies, from convenient access to pharmacies and clinics to free college degrees and vocational training programs for hourly employees.We recognize the economic challenges facing all working families. And we continually meet with our employees in the process of developing even stronger programs. Still, we’re proud of the work we’ve done to improve the lives of our employees, and of the more than 45,000 jobs we’ve added in the United States since 2005. The men and women who make Disney parks such a special experience for millions of people are dedicated, hardworking and proud, and we will continue to listen to, empower and reward them. That’s what this company has done throughout its history and will continue to do in the future.”Source Fox News & the Walt Disney Company Follow Chip and Co on Instagram @chipandco or on Twitter @chipandcompanyWatch our latest Youtube Videos here.Visit our Facebook Page or You Might be a Disney Addict Facebook Group. Maybe when you average the workers low wages with the million dollar big wigs salaries, you average 19.50 an hour.Wow 19.50 an hour????? I’m Entertainment Costuming Support fabricator using power tools and I’m only at 16.00. AND I’m a certified Electrician. Go figure.Lmao where is this $19.50? Currently at $11.50 working in food and beverage. What a joke.I’ve worked for WDW since April 2017 started in attractions at $10/hr. Moved on about 6 months later to Bus driving for $12.65hr contract came to a close negotiations took forever and since then we have gotten little raises over time to now being at $15.15 $15/hr to carry a class B CDL and drive in all sorts of conditions and responsibilities of guests lives in our hands. And under constant watch and job insecurity because a guest claimed we used our brakes to hard to stop at a stoplight or another car cutting us off. $19.50 is really far fetched average considering that attractions, food and beverage, custodial security, operations coordinators, guest relations, resort greeters etc all make less than bus drivers. Bus Drivers earned an average salary of $43,290 in 2017 I’m the US. Which means should be higher in 2019 and I can tell you I won’t get to 40k and I’m full time sometimes working 6 days a week. Take this info however you like!I worked at Disneyland, Anaheim in 1998 for $7 and hour. I left in 2000, making $7.25 and hour. I returned in 2014, starting at $9 and hour, I left in 2016 earning $9.29 an hour. Keep in mind there are hourly cast members and their are the trade workers in powerful unions who make over $30 an hour. We hourly cast members are forced to join a union (Teamsters for attractions, SEIU for retail, etc.). We pay union dues for union rep for contracts and are told to be happy with a 24 cent raise by the feckless unions. Benefits, like sign-in privileges have been stunted with additional block out days and shift hours are cut back and they only allow so many full time positions because those positions offer medical and other worker benefits, so they are limited.I applied to a for a job in Orlando as a stage hand. its a union job. I hold the same job here in NYC (even working at times for Disney subsidiaries such as ABC TV and Disney theatrical) I was offered full time employment at $19.50 an hour. the current wage here in NYC to do the same job is $54 an hour. The guy from HR that was offering me the job had access to my other employee files and can see my current rates and was very understanding when I turned him down…Thank you Chip and Company for doing what you do it’s very helpful. Our legacy family is trying to hang in there currently providing car support and insurance help as well as other expenses to our daughter making $13 an hour that’s sharing a house with four others at WDW. 25 years ago I made nine dollars an hour there and it’s surprising wages haven’t really gone anywhere it’s been stagnant. Just a shame!If you don’t like the pay, then LEAVE! I don’t have a college degree. I work as a vet assistant at a clinic for the past 6 years and I went from $9/hr to $14.50/hr. Stop complaining and find a new job. It can be done.Disney putting a spin on things yet again. I just looked up the contract, most “Cast Members” ie employees are making close to minimum wage. Few positions under local 50 contract make or exceed the 20 per hour quoted.Disney stop putting a spin on things and admit it, you underpay your workers and do everything in your power to keep people from becoming full time and getting more benefits.My daughter worked at Disney….both. I had to supplement monthly so she had groceriers. Long hours low pay….hard to feel magical with that pressure. Hoping they do better starting now!!I don’t know anyone getting paid 19.50 we only get 4 hrs shift with the minimum payment 12.50 you can spend years here and you will never get paid 19.50 unless manager does….This makes me so sad. We love Disney World, but this article, and especially the comments, changed my opinion of it. My daughter wants to go back next year since it’s been several years, but now I don’t think so. I can’t support a company that treats it’s employees terribly while they rake in billions. No conscience, no remorse. Employees that are treated well are loyal and will bend over backwards for you and the company will benefit tremendously.I’ve been at Disney a long time. I started in 2002 at $7.25 an hour. Currently I have a “tested into, skill based job.” I make $11.50 an hour. (And I’m one of the top people) How Does It Possibly Average $19.50!?!I wish I made that!For Gods sake give all these hard working indivisible people a GODDAM raise !! These are the folks that make your magic happen for all of us!Ouch. Talk about a PR fail on Disney. They better clean up this mess.Hey I just quit Disneyland 3 days ago and the company only paid my job title 12$ an hour !!!!! When I first started working there back in October. In my interview I was told I would have a part time job. Guess what going through the process and traditions, I finally get my work schedule and I was only scheduled 4 hours a week!!!! You heard me 4 hours a week!!!! That is not even a job! There was literally no point in going there!!! This schedule was given to me for about 3 months and than they bumped it up 8 hours a weeek!!!!!!! Disney is lying to the public! The worker conditions and expectations are terrible! Not a great place anymore!! Stop lying to the public to save Mickey’s face!!!!!!!!!!!! Abigail Disney is 100% correct ! Lots of Disney employees are miserable and not happy !!! This is the fact! Disneyland is backed up my cons!! I am sorry to say. Walt Disney is rolling in his grave! It is a disgrace!To the spineless anonymous worm who left this comment:“Do you really expect to get a living wage from doing an entry level job? If they can fill your position within a week of you leaving then you are disposable. Make yourself into an employee they can’t function without. Then you can leverage yourself to make more money.”Let’s pick this apart.“Do you really expect to get a living wage from doing an entry level job?” Is that entry level job 40 hours a week? Then yes. It should pay enough for whoever takes it to live. Working full-time hours means that, whatever your level of education and training, you have entered the workforce full-time and your pay should be sufficient to support you.“If they can fill your position within a week of you leaving then you are disposable.” In a company that employs tens of thousands of people, everyone is disposable–up to and including the high-level management. If someone leaves at any level, there are a dozen other people already employed there that can cover the work–they won’t even have to hire anyone immediately. And odds are, they don’t want to. Companies this size would rather depend on mandatory overtime, part time workers, and underpaid interns than open up a single FTE position, because they don’t want to have to pay those benefits if they can get away with not doing so. And they can get away with it.“Make yourself into an employee they can’t function without.” Again, there’s no such thing, but even if there was, doing this takes TIME. In a company this size, you work a couple years to build up the credentials, then go up against dozens, if not hundreds, of other people vying for a handful of promotion spots. Are you seriously saying that, during those years, a full-time worker does not deserve to be paid enough to live on?“Then you can leverage yourself to make more money.” Again, laughable. Not in a company this size. Unless you move up the ladder against the very unfriendly odds, you can’t negotiate for a raise while staying in the same position. No matter how good you are at your job, you’re one of thousands doing it. They pay everyone according to a formula, and refuse to deviate from it. You get your additional 25 cents per hour pay raise on the anniversary of your employment each year, and ‘leveraging’ will get you fired.It’s obvious you’re clueless about what it’s like to work in this environment, but I’m not. Ask me how I know.Don’t include your high executives in your average. We are not that stupid.Working at Epcot in 2011 and 2014, I sure did not earn $19.50 an hour… who is this article going on about? Believe it was $7.95 my first year and $8-something the second.Don’t get me wrong, I loved working at Disney, but this seems like a very wrong representation of what the majority of cast members actually earn.You all better go with this article and demand a pay raise and back pay.I never made anywhere close to $19 an hour at Disney World. I was working 6 days a week, multiple shifts, and still had to “nickel and dime” everything to ensure I had enough money leftover after bills to buy food. There’s a reason the parks have zucchini a high turnover rate. It’s funny that cast members have been struggling for years with unfair wages and now when Abigail Disney actually confirms the working conditions and monetary struggle Disney quickly denies everything. What’s even funnier is that her family founded Disney and now the company is basically calling her findings a fraud. Talk about being stabbed in the back.If this was 1996 or 2001 or even 2012 I would be against Disney but NOW? No! The company does provide a lot to us cast members and although the pay NOT be great to some it was and is much better than we had in the years mentioned. I think we got more than ever in our last contract in the years that I worked there and hoping it will be more so the better next time we negotiate. Baby steps but again, more so better than before.Mr. Iger and the Walt Disney Company, when you state $19.50 an hour you are of course including you Salary Management positions up to including the Vice Presidents in this figure. I’ve gone through many of your contract talks with Ms. J. Robbin Almand and Bill Pace and each time your company offers $.25 (twenty-five cents) when they come in the door thinking the actual worker will accept it. This past contract talks you learned different. We took the fight to your doorstep including your annual stockholders meeting where you were so ashamed to listen to the rank and file that you shut the meeting down before your stockholders could speak. Shame on you. Let me make this clear, we the workers at Walt Disney are not asking you for the shirt off you back, we just want a fair wage, you sir make enough money in one hour to exceed what the average hourly cast member earns in a year.I have worked for the company 11 years in an Office and Technical role, I don’t make $19.50/hr. I don’t even know anyone who under a collective bargaining agreement who makes that much a hour. Yes the benefits are great but the bigger picture is no one should have to work 80+ hrs a week to pay rent/mortgage. Many front line employees work 6 to 7 days per week and more than 8 hour shifts. Yes some of the hours are voluntary but some are required to just survive.Do you really expect to get a living wage from doing an entry level job? If they can fill your position within a week of you leaving then you are disposable. Make yourself into an employee they can’t function without. Then you can leverage yourself to make more money.I came here to laugh at you Disney. And i did. Now we know how much to demand. 19.75 per hour 2020This article is totally bs! I worked for walt Disney and making 10$ an hr working 6 days a week my husband and I had to move in with his parents and continue to live pay check to pay check. I got injured on one of their attractions and they wanted me to walk the park to do transitional duty with a torn acl. They paid me less than 200$ a week while I was out and when I left the company they wanted to pay me off in a settlement to never work for them again. They dont care about employees or their families.So they’re still going to ignore the homeless/hotel bound cm’s? I was homeless for several months in 2012 and was working 65+ hours a week to try and get a place. I ended up getting a room in an extended stay hotel for a few months. I had neighbors who had been living there for years trying to come out ahead to get an apartment. I ended up being able to borrow a little money from family so I was able to go in with two others on an income restricted apartment. Hell. Just hell. After 5 years at wdw I left making 8.45 an hour. Two months later I had a new job with better benefits making $11 an hour (with no college degree like many of my coworkers)Almost 10 years with the company no where near 19.50. I’d like to know who makes that?this article is a lie. ive been working for Disney almost 10yr and i don’t even make $13 an hr. i started in 09, making $7.45. most of the time i don’t make enough money to feed myself like i should. i live an hr away too. cause i cant afford anything closer. most of the time management treats employies like crap like they don’t matter. they don’t value their workers. yet they have these programs which are nice but when you pay for some of them it comes out from your paycheck n when you don’t already have enough money. well you don’t partcipate. don’t know why a CEO needs to be paid 80 million dollars or more but im sure thats well over what someone needs to live. while his work force cant pay rent or cant buy enough grociers for themselves. she is right with what she thinks n says, cause ive seen a lot.Who’s getting paid $19.50 an hour. I’ve been working at Disney World since 2017 (2015 if college programs counted), and am only being paid $12.50 an hour.Disney is a joke. Horrible way they treat employees. I’ve seen some of the best discarded when they needed time off.I worked for Disney approximately 6 months in 2018, and quit because every week we were forced (mandated) to work one of our days off. Each week, our mandatory overtime day would change, so we couldn’t even make plans with our family, doctor appointments, etc.As far as the “generous” leave policy, another lie. We were told that we were not allowed to request leave until our probationary pert was over (9 months). I even asked a manager for my anniversary off and he said that I had to call out sick because they were not allowed to grant leave until you have been there 9 months. I gave these reasons when I resigned in hopes that they would change these rules, but no one ever responded. They really don’t care about employees.I think they’re counting in all the Executive’s and Bob Iger pay in the mixDisney World employees DO NOT make 19.50 an hour.$19.50 an hour,, Utter BS…. I think owe me some money….Average hourly wage of $19.50 doesn’t mean anything. You will still have a LOT of people working at $10.00 per hour. In addition, it never addresses the disparity between the regular Disney employee and the CEO.$19.50 an hour? You wanna see my pay stub? 9 1/2 years and I’m at $12 bucks an hour.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104129" src="http://www.chipandco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/newsletter.png" alt="newsletter" width="200" height="85" />

If Dutch forces had given the men the chance to stay in their compound, there was just a 10% chance they would not have fallen into the hands of the Serbs, and so the Dutch state should be liable for only that proportion of the damages suffered by the bereaved, the court ruled.The final verdict draws a line under years of legal battles between the Dutch state and the plaintiffs - a group of victims' relatives known as the Mothers of Srebrenica.The case was escalated to the highest court because the state wanted to be cleared of responsibility, while the Mothers of Srebrenica wanted it to be held accountable for all 8,000 deaths in the genocide.An appeals court had previously set the liability at 30%, but the supreme court's ruling has drastically reduced that figure.During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Serb army was engaged in an ethnic-cleansing operation. Thousands of Muslims sought safety in Srebrenica, which the UN was protecting with Dutch forces, but the area fell in July 1995 during a Serb offensive. When the Serb army moved in to Srebrenica, approximately 20,000 Muslims - mostly women, children and the infirm - sought refuge in the Dutch compound in nearby Potocari.As the violence escalated, the Dutch surrendered and later agreed to help the Serbs load Muslim refugees on to buses.The 350 men were among those made to leave the base. The court said the chance that they would have survived if they had stayed "was small but not negligible". "Dutchbat [the troops] acted unlawfully in the evacuation of 350 men," the court found, according to Reuters news agency. "They took away the chance of the men to stay out of the hands of the Bosnian Serbs."A lower court had previously ruled that the Dutch were liable for the deaths.  In 2017, an appeals court largely upheld the ruling, but reduced the responsibility to 30%.A figure for the compensation has not yet been set. The Mothers of Srebrenica had also originally sought acknowledgement and compensation from the UN as well, but the organisation was ruled to be immune from prosecution.  6-8 July 1995: Bosnian Serb forces start shelling Srebrenica enclave9 July: Bosnian Serbs step up shelling; thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees flee to Srebrenica10 July: Dutch peacekeepers request UN air support after Bosnian Serbs shell Dutch positions.

Next ArticleChandrayaan-2 Launch Rescheduled for July 22The current year has seen at least three asteroids moving dangerously close to the earth, namely, 2019 NN3, 2019 MB4 and 2019 MT2. Another asteroid, ‘2019 NJ2’, is likely to join this list on Friday.The asteroid 2019 NJ2 is estimated to have an approximate diameter of 63 metres, and it is traveling at a speed of 48,280 km/h. The Centre of Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) forecasts that NJ2 is likely to reach closest to the Earth’s surface by Friday evening around 3:53 PM EDT, or just before 1.30 am IST Saturday morning. The asteroid will be around 3.1 million miles from our planet during this period.NJ2 was first observed on June 29 this year. Earlier, it was nearest to the Earth in 1952 when it was flying close to Venus. CNEOS also predicts that NJ2 will return close to our planet the next time around July 7, 2119. However, it is likely to be at a significantly longer distance in 100 years.  Some other asteroids that have moved past the Earth include 2006 QV89, 2016 NO56M and RF12 as well. The Earth’s gravity pulls asteroids very close to our planet but we have been lucky enough to have survived the wrath of mass destruction. A large meteorite exploded over the Bering Sea on December 18 last year. As per NASA, the explosion released 173 kilotons of energy, which is 10 times more than the Hiroshima atomic bomb blast. However, this explosion went unnoticed as it happened in a remote area.© Copyright TWC Product and Technology LLC 2014, 2019

A new report by the Defence Innovation Agency (DIA) said the visionaries will "propose scenarios of disruption" that military strategists may not think of.The team's highly confidential work will be important in the fight against "malicious elements", the report states.It comes amid efforts by the French to innovate its approaches to defence. An inventor piloted his jet-powered flyboard over crowds at Bastille Day military celebrations in Paris on Sunday.Tweeting after Franky Zapata stunned crowds, President Emmanuel Macron said: "Proud of our army, modern and innovative" with a video of the stunt. Comprised of just four or five sci-fi writers, the group will be expected to think more creatively than more traditional elements of the army. Through role play and other techniques, the team will attempt to imagine how terrorist organisations or foreign states could use advanced technology.French Defence Minister Florence Parly said the country "holds all the aces in this race" for military innovation. Also on display at the Bastille celebrations was the futuristic-looking Nerod F5 microwave jammer, a rifle-shaped weapon designed to target drones by blocking the pilot's signals.There have even been plans for robots to support French troops in Mali, with experiments currently underway.

AdvertisementSupported byTrump’s bigoted attack on four congresswomen of color has nothing to do with fighting anti-Semitism.By Michelle GoldbergOpinion ColumnistSebastian Gorka, a onetime adviser to Donald Trump, wore a medal from the Vitezi Rend, a Hungarian group historically aligned with Nazism, to one of Trump’s inaugural balls. Gorka was reportedly a member of the group, whose founder, the Hungarian autocrat Miklos Horthy, once said, “For all my life, I have been an anti-Semite.”Max Berger is a Jewish social justice activist who has long been deeply involved in Jewish communal life. He’s the co-founder of IfNotNow, a group of Americans Jews devoted to ending Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, and recently joined Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.In a tweet this month, one of these men tarred the other as an anti-Semite. If you’ve been following the increasingly bizarre turn that American discussion of anti-Semitism has taken, you can probably guess which one.That’s right, it was Gorka who called Berger an anti-Semite, for having once joined in an internet in-joke about a nonexistent group called “Friends of Hamas.” (Gorka’s tweet appears to have since been deleted.) It wasn’t the only time this month that Gorka accused a Jew of Jew-hating; he’s also charged the anti-Trump conservative writer Anne Applebaum with “standing with the anti-Semites,” demanding that she explain “how you justify this to the community.”If this were just Gorka, you could dismiss it as trolling. But his tweets were only a particularly brazen example of how right-wing gentiles are wrapping themselves in a smarmy philo-Semitism to attack the left, even when that means attacking either individual Jews or the political interests of most Jewish Americans.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]Such Christian appropriation of the fight against anti-Semitism reached its grim nadir this week. As Trump’s racist invective against Omar and three other freshman Democratic congresswomen has dominated the news, the president’s defenders have used Jews as human shields, pretending that hatred of the quartet is rooted in abhorrence of anti-Semitism. On Tuesday, an evangelical outfit called Proclaiming Justice to the Nations accused the Anti-Defamation League — the Anti-Defamation League! — of siding with anti-Semites after the ADL called out Trump’s racism. The group even had the audacity to hurl a Hebrew denunciation — “lashon hara,” or “evil tongue” — at the Jewish civil rights organization.Republicans are only a short step away from such shamelessness when they try to deflect from the president’s racism by accusing his foes of anti-Semitism. “Montanans are sick and tired of listening to anti-American, anti-Semite, radical Democrats trash our country and our ideals,” Senator Steve Daines of Montana tweeted on Monday, proclaiming his solidarity with Trump.It’s true that Omar has said things that were freighted with anti-Semitism, for which she has expressed regret. But it is grotesque to argue that that excuses racism against her, or that Trump’s taunts have anything to do with protecting Jews. This is a president who regularly deploys anti-Semitic tropes and whose ex-wife said that he slept with a volume of Hitler’s speeches by his bed. When speaking to American Jews, he’s called Israel “your country” and Benjamin Netanyahu “your prime minister,” suggesting that in his mind, we don’t fully belong here any more than Omar does.When the right presents Trump as an enemy of anti-Semitism, it goes beyond hypocrisy. Jews have thrived here as they have in few other places in the world because America at least aspires to be a multiethnic democracy, not an ethnostate. If Trump succeeds in making citizenship racialized and contingent, that’s an existential threat to American Jews.Trump and his accomplices are simultaneously assaulting the political foundation of Jewish life in America and claiming they’re doing it on the Jews’ behalf. As the Montana Association of Rabbis wrote in an open letter to Daines on Wednesday, “We refuse to allow the real threat of anti-Semitism to be weaponized and exploited by those who themselves share a large part of the responsibility for the rise of white nationalist and anti-Semitic violence in this country.”It’s worth thinking about how we got to a point where anti-Semitism can be exploited as it has been this week. What we’re seeing is the absurd but logical endpoint of efforts to conflate anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism, and anti-Zionism with opposition to Israel’s right-wing government. Only if these concepts are interchangeable can Jewish critics of Israel be the perpetrators of anti-Semitism and gentiles who play footsie with fascism be allies of the Jewish people. Only if these concepts are the same can an evangelical group claim that Jews are being anti-Jewish when they protest Trump, because Trump loves Israel.Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the liberal Zionist group J Street, puts part of the blame for this rhetorical derangement at the feet of the American Jewish establishment. Its leaders made an alliance of convenience with right-wing Christian Zionists, who support the state of Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a bulwark of Western values in the Middle East, but care little about pluralism in the United States. The Jewish leaders, said Ben-Ami, “made a deal with the devil. And what they’ve done is they’ve laid down in bed with white nationalists and racists and bigots.” Now white nationalists and racists and bigots — and those politically aligned with them — feel entitled to use their backing of Israel as an alibi when their leader indulges in racist incitement.“When they start asking people to go back where they came from, that’s the first line of attack on the Jewish people over centuries,” said Ben-Ami. It’s terrifying enough to have a president who says such things. It’s an almost incalculable insult for Trump and his enablers to act as if he’s helping the Jews when he adopts the language of the pogrom.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

				If you earn minimum wage and live in Vancouver, you would need to work 112 hours a week to afford a decent two-bedroom apartment, a new study says.According to a new Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives report, minimum wage earners in most major cities would need to work much longer hours in order to rent an average two-bedroom unit.

		“The rental wage across the country is $22 an hour for a two-bedroom or $20 an hour for a one-bedroom,” report author and economist David Macdonald said Wednesday. “But it’s much more in big cities like Vancouver and Toronto.” The report calculates rental wages by breaking down the hourly wage that full-time minimum wage workers would need to earn in order to afford rent for an average one- or two-bedroom apartment without spending more than 30 per cent of their earnings. WATCH: (Sept. 8, 2018) B.C. can expect highest rent hikes in 15 years in 2019It also calculates how many hours minimum wage earners would need to work to afford an average apartment. Minimum wage workers in Vancouver would need to make the highest rental wage — $35.43 an hour — to afford a two-bedroom apartment. In Toronto, that is pegged at $33.70 an hour. The report covers 795 neighbourhoods across Canada and finds that 31 of the 36 Canadian cities included in the report don’t have a single neighbourhood where a minimum wage earner could afford a two-bedroom apartment. “It’s actually true in almost all the big cities in Canada that even at the neighborhood level, you can’t find a one- or two-bedroom apartment being affordable for a minimum wage worker,” Macdonald said.

		The report uses rental data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). According to the report, increasing housing costs impact one-third of all Canadians. And since minimum wages across provinces are less than the rental wages in the report, more minimum wage earners are spending 30 per cent or more of their income on housing. The report’s findings can be explored province by province here.

At $11.55 an hour, minimum wage workers could rent an average two-bedroom on a 78-hour workweek.Sherbrooke, Que.At $12 an hour, minimum wage workers here would have to work 41 hours a week for a two-bedroom apartment.

The president says if Democratic congresswomen criticize the US, they should go elsewhere. But mocking America is one of his own favorite pastimes
Luke O'Neil

Fri 19 Jul 2019 08.28 EDT


First published on Fri 19 Jul 2019 02.00 EDT

At a campaign rally in North Carolina last night, the president’s attacks against four progressive congresswomen of color culminated in his most overt attack yet. Referring to Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib as “hate-filled extremists”, he continued his tirade to the delight of his supporters.“They’re always telling us how to run it, how to do this, how to do that. You know what? If they don’t love it, tell ’em to leave it,” Trump said to the crowd, who soon erupted into a chant of “send her back”.Yet Trump himself has repeatedly denigrated and criticized America, perhaps more so than any other presidential candidate in recent memory. If he holds himself to his own standards, perhaps it’s time for him to leave and “go back home”?Here are some examples of Trump’s attacks on the US.A longtime critic of Obama, Trump has said he came upon his famed slogan the day his predecessor was elected to his second term. The Maga slogan implied that America was no longer great, something he also repeatedly and explicitly stated in much starker terms in the years before and during his run. Speaking to the Washington Post in 2017, he said:I looked at the many types of illness our country had, and whether it’s at the border, whether it’s security, whether it’s law and order or lack of law and order.Trump’s 2015 book, Crippled America, was rife with critical quotes, referring to the country as “this mess” and “Uncle Sucker”, among other things, and took great pains to point out just how weak we had become.The idea of American Greatness, of our country as the leader of the free and unfree world, has vanished ... I couldn’t stand to see what was happening to our great country. This mess calls for leadership in the worst way.On the day he took office in 2017, Trump painted a picture of America as a dystopian nightmare.Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.The idea that criticizing the country is grounds for being dismissed from it would be news to the Donald Trump of the Obama years, when he described our collective humiliation many dozens of times.Stretching back to 2011, he regularly tweeted about which countries and other political bodies were laughing at us and Obama, from Opec to “the mullahs”, Sudan, and, most frequently, China and Vladimir Putin.US Gov't is on the hook for more than a third of the world's entire debt & we wonder why China & OPEC are laughing all the way to the bank!Thanks to @BarackObama rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, China has become Canada's biggest oil consumer. China is laughing at us!Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.When asked during an interview with Bill O’Reilly in 2017 about his praise for Putin, Trump said America wasn’t much better. But was Putin was “a killer”, O’Reilly said. Trump replied:There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?Trump has not only often referred to the symbolic collapse of America, he’s also pointed out its literal state of disrepair. His speech to the 2016 Republican national convention was a laundry list of things that he found shameful about the country, including our infrastructure. He told the crowd:Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third-world condition.


The U.S. Coast Guard has warned that American is falling behind Russia in the race to dominate the Arctic, as warming global temperatures open up areas previously inaccessible due to ice.Speaking at the Aspen Security Conference, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz said American leaders had serious concerns that they were lagging behind Russia in the world's newest military frontier."Russia has a huge Arctic coastline, they have clear Arctic interest, they derive their GDP from there," Schutlz explained, according to Russian state news agency Tass. "From the security standpoint and the militarizing of the Arctic, that is probably the future place for a contentious situation."The Pentagon recently released a new Arctic strategy document that indicated it considers the far north increasingly important in a new era of great power competition with Russia and China.Moscow is deploying more resources northwards and investing in Arctic-capable forces, while Beijing has declared itself a "near-Arctic" power. The U.S. is moving to meet this challenge and give the region more prominence in its strategic planning.Schultz said the U.S. "should be concerned about Russia, who is way ahead of us in this game, and the emerging aggressive China, who is pushing into the game." He noted that while Americans may "think about the Arctic as a very faraway place," the "Russian world view is very much based on the Arctic."Its importance to Russia is reflected in Moscow's investment in Arctic resources. Though its economy and military budget are dwarfed by those of the U.S., Russia maintains a fleet of dozens of icebreakers while the U.S. only has two. Schultz also warned that while China is still behind both nations, it will "outbuild" the U.S. by 2025.A "polar security cutter" is currently under construction for the Coast Guard, effectively a militarized ice breaker. Its order demonstrates the U.S military pivot towards the Arctic and an effort to close the gap with its rivals, particularly Russia.In May, Schutlz told Defense News, "We talk about the Arctic through a different lens now. We talk about the Arctic as a competitive space." He noted that both Russia and China are bolstering their Arctic capability, and stressed the U.S must do the same."We're championing increased capabilities in the Arctic, we're championing better communications, better domain awareness, we're talking about innovation, we're talking about resiliency, we're talking about rule-based order," he continued."I want to see the Arctic remain a peaceful domain. China's a self-declared Arctic state. They're not one of the eight Arctic nations, so for me, for the service, its presence equals influence."Schultz told the Aspen Security Conference that the U.S. above all desires a "peaceful, environmentally safe" Arctic region. He noted that American forces currently cooperate with Russia on search and rescue missions and a satellite system used by mariners world wide. "I think we absolutely need to find the common ground," he said.Though Schutlz said the U.S. wants an "environmentally safe" Arctic, the Pentagon's recent strategy report omitted the term "climate change" entirely, Axios noted. Though it notes melting sea ice and rising temperatures, the document does not acknowledge the human factor element in the changes.© 2019 Newsweek

Passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight got more than a small bottle of water when they boarded their plane.
They received a Nintendo Switch system and a download code for the digital version of the "Super Mario Maker 2" game to enjoy as Flight 2246 traveled from Dallas to San Diego on Wednesday. Many of the passengers were headed to Comic Con in the California city.
Mario was on hand to greet the passengers when the flight arrived.
The gaming-themed flight highlighted Southwest's partnership with Nintendo in the Let's Play Getaway sweepstakes that awards a daily winner a Nintendo Switch system and a download code for the digital version.
The sweepstakes ends Aug. 31 with a grand prize winner and three guests receiving roundtrip air travel.


BRUSSELS (AP) — AB Inbev, the world’s biggest brewer with brands like Budweiser and Corona, said Friday it is selling its unit in Australia to reduce debt after it decided against listing shares in Asia.The company is selling Carlton & United Breweries for $16 billion AUD ($11.3 billion) to Japanese rival Asahi Group.AB Inbev, which is based in Belgium, said it will use almost all the money from the deal to pay down debt. The company has accrued a mountain of debt - about $100 billion - after going on an acquisition spree, including buying Anheuser-Busch in 2008 and its next closest rival, SABMiller, in 2015.The SABMiller deal, which was worth some $107 billion at the time, gave the company broader reach in fast-growing markets in Asia and Africa at a time when consumers were shifting toward smaller brands like microbrews.It gave it almost a third of the global beer market and put established brands that had formerly been rivals under the same roof - American icons Budweiser and Miller, for example.AB Inbev has sought to shed some brands to slim down its debt load and had planned to list some shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to further bolster its finances. But it said this month that it no longer planned to list those shares due to tough market conditions.

        The Polish conservative newspaper, Gazeta Polska, has said it will distribute "LGBT-free zone" stickers with its next issue.
The stickers show a black cross superimposed on a rainbow flag. 
The weekly publication - which has a circulation of around 110,000 - openly supports the conservative governing Law and Justice party (PiS).
The move was criticised by the US ambassador to Poland, who said the stickers promoted hatred.
The newspaper's editor said his own views and those of the ambassador should both be respected. 
Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.A preview of the sticker was posted on Gazeta Polska's Twitter feed on Wednesday and it is due to be included in next week's edition. 
US ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher expressed concern.
"I am disappointed and concerned that some groups use stickers to promote hatred and intolerance. We respect freedom of speech, but we must stand together on the side of values such as diversity and tolerance," Ms Mosbacher tweeted. 
In response, the newspaper's editor, Tomasz Sakiewicz, tweeted that "being an activist in the gay movement does not make anyone more tolerant".
"Poles love freedom and have known the word tolerance for centuries. That's why they supported the rise of the USA," he added. 
Paweł Rabiej, the deputy mayor of Warsaw, said he would file a complaint about the stickers to the prosecutor's office.
"German fascists created Jew-free zones," he tweeted. 
"As you can see this tradition finds worthy followers, this time in Poland," he said, adding that it was happening "under the umbrella" of the governing party and bishops. 
Polish attitudes to homosexuality are evolving but gay marriage is still outlawed, unlike in many Western European countries.

A new report by the Defence Innovation Agency (DIA) said the visionaries will "propose scenarios of disruption" that military strategists may not think of.The team's highly confidential work will be important in the fight against "malicious elements", the report states.It comes amid efforts by the French to innovate its approaches to defence. An inventor piloted his jet-powered flyboard over crowds at Bastille Day military celebrations in Paris on Sunday.Tweeting after Franky Zapata stunned crowds, President Emmanuel Macron said: "Proud of our army, modern and innovative" with a video of the stunt. Comprised of just four or five sci-fi writers, the group will be expected to think more creatively than more traditional elements of the army. Through role play and other techniques, the team will attempt to imagine how terrorist organisations or foreign states could use advanced technology.French Defence Minister Florence Parly said the country "holds all the aces in this race" for military innovation. Also on display at the Bastille celebrations was the futuristic-looking Nerod F5 microwave jammer, a rifle-shaped weapon designed to target drones by blocking the pilot's signals.There have even been plans for robots to support French troops in Mali, with experiments currently underway.

China is not the villain in the global trading system that the Trump administration likes to portray it as, the International Monetary Fund said, in a new report released Wednesday.After years when China ran a large current account surplus based on export-led growth, the IMF said that China’s current account deficit, the widest measure of China’s trade balance, its current account, was “broadly in line with fundamentals” in 2018.The country’s trade picture was helped by a massive increase in outbound tourism, that widened its deficit in services,Who are the country’s with the largest trade surpluses?Germany and the Netherlands top the list, as South Korea and Singapore, the IMF said.But that doesn’t mean these countries should be the target of any aggressive bilateral trade campaign by the Trump administration.Indeed, Gina Gopinath, the IMF’s new chief economist, said that aggressive bilateral trade negotiations favored by the Trump administration have had no discernible impact on global imbalances and have just caused harm.The U.S. trade tariffs have led to increased prices for consumers, an erosion of business confidence and a disruption of trade patterns.Gopinath said trade balances “reflect macro-policies that affect macro savings and investments,” and these are the policies that need reform.For instance, in the euro-area, one policy that might bring better trade balance would be higher wage growth, the IMF report said.And the U.S. and UK should find “growth-friendly” ways to lower their budget deficits, the report said.Gopinath said the IMF welcomed the trade truce reached between the U.S. and China at the G-20 meeting in June, as any intensification of the bilateral trade dispute could have caused significant damage to the global economy.If all the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, in place or threatened, had been enacted, it would have reduced the level of global GDP in 2020 by 0.5%, Gopinath said.“So this is a significant cost to the global economy at a time when global trade is already very weak and investment is weak in the world,” Gopinath said.The IMF is set to release its latest assessment on the health of the global economy next week.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has been citing the weaker global economic outlook as one reason many on the central bank feel a need to cut interest-rates. Morgan Stanley said this reflects the growing importance of the overseas economy on U.S. GDP.

Standing in front of an F-35 jet parked at an Israeli Air Force base, Netanyahu barely held back a smile as he said that Israel can reach Iran, but Iran cannot reach Israel.He didn't add the words  "undetected by radar," but it was surely implied.To understand why that soundbite with the visual backdrop was more than just bluster, you have trace the F-35's incredible history in the Middle East over the past four years.You don't have to be a military genius to know that a supersonic jet that can fly undetected by radar for hundreds of miles will make a difference anywhere in the world. But the F-35's already powerful impact in the Middle East was multiplied extensively during the months leading up to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. That was still more than a year before the jet was put into service anywhere in the world.But it was late summer 2015 when reports in the Israeli news media surfaced about how Israelis working on F-35 prototypes had managed to double the jet's flight and stealth capacity. It wasn't lost on anyone that the extension meant Israeli Air Force pilots could use the F-35 to fly from Israel to Tehran and back without detection -- and without having to refuel at U.S. air bases in Saudi Arabia or Iraq.Suddenly, U.S.-Israeli air superiority in the region had risen to a new level. Saudi Arabia had already begun the process of cooperating more with Israel on defense and security matters for some time, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at during a  "60 Minutes" interview after President Trump's election. But the idea of letting Israeli jets land and refuel in that Arab country was still a stretch in 2015. Iraqi leaders were also not receptive to the idea. But the new technology was now rendering the objections moot.The move only acted to bring the Saudis and the Israelis closer. It was one thing for the two countries to have a common enemy in Iran that was on the verge of getting billions of dollars and a clear, if supposedly delayed, path to a nuclear weapon. But with the new F-35 and its expanded capacities in the picture, there was something more tangible than political promises and intelligence sharing to hang their hopes on.All of that made it easier for King Salman to shake up his regime and name Mohammed bin Salman the new crown prince. Mohammad, who is aggressive on defense, wasted little time enhancing military ties with Israel and the U.S. There was even an unconfirmed report that he visited Israel secretly in September 2017.Yet the most direct effects of the F-35 were still to come. In July 2018, a Kuwaiti newspaper reported that Israel had flown a test mission of at least three F-35 jets to Tehran and back from an airbase near Tel Aviv. While never confirmed publicly, a good number of military and political leaders in the region believed and still believe the story. The long-rumored threat the F-35 posed to Iran now seemed like a reality.Earlier this month, reports in the same Kuwaiti newspaper said that Iran's military leadership panicked enough over the purported stealth mission that it kept news of it from reaching Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.But when Khamenei found out about the mission, he reportedly moved to fire not only Iran's air force chief but also the long-serving and powerful commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. That's major impact without even firing a shot.All of this comes as Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has decided to choose procuring Russia's S-400 missile program at the expense of getting promised F-35s from the U.S. Judging by how much his neighbors in the region fear and revere the F-35, this appears to be a ruinous choice.The impact of the F-35's development has had a major financial impact, as well. Since reports of the Israeli stealth enhancement first surfaced, Lockheed Martin shares are up more the 75%. The F-35 program is also the most expensive defense project in U.S. history, and it has faced a long history of criticism for that cost.But considering how much the very existence of the jet has already achieved in Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran, it may already be more than worth it.Jake Novak is a political and economic analyst at Jake Novak News and former CNBC TV producer.

Ankara (AFP) - Turkey on Thursday launched an air attack on Iraqi Kurdistan in response to the killing of a Turkish diplomat in the region, the country's defence minister said.The Turkish vice consul to Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region was shot dead Wednesday in the local capital Arbil. Police sources said two other people were also killed.There was no claim of responsibility for the shooting, but many Iraqi experts have pointed to the probability that the Turkish separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara considers a terrorist group, was behind the attack."Following the evil attack in Arbil, we have launched the most comprehensive air operation on Qandil and dealt a heavy blow to the (PKK) terror organisation," defence minister Hulusi Akar said in a statement.Targets such as "armaments positions, lodgings, shelters and caves belonging to terrorists" were destroyed."Our fight against terror will continue with increasing determination until the last terrorist is neutralised and the blood of our martyrs will be avenged," he added.The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which now leads the regional government, enjoys good political and trade relations with Turkey.But Turkey has been conducting a ground offensive and bombing campaign since May in the mountainous northern region to root out the PKK which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.Earlier this month, the PKK announced that one of those raids killed senior PKK leader Diyar Gharib Mohammed along with two other fighters.A spokesman for the PKK's armed branch denied the group was involved in Wednesday's shooting.


KYOTO: A man suspected of torching an animation studio, killing 33 people in Japan's worst mass killing in two decades, carried out the attack because he believed his novel had been plagiarised, local media reported on Friday (Jul 19).The man wheeled a trolley carrying at least one bucket of petrol to the entrance of the Kyoto Animation studio before dousing the area, shouting "die" and setting it ablaze on Thursday, broadcaster Nippon TV said, citing police.Police identified the suspected arsonist as Shinji Aoba, who was taken into custody soon after the attack, local broadcaster NHK said, adding that he had not been arrested."I did it," the 41-year-old told police when he was detained, Kyodo News reported. It said that he had started the fire because he believed the studio had stolen his novel.NHK reported that Aoba suffers from a mental illness and served three-and-a-half years in prison after stealing cash from a convenience store.Police declined to comment. Broadcaster Nippon TV said the suspect was under anaesthesia because of burns he suffered and police were unable to question him."(He) seemed to be discontented, he seemed to get angry, shouting something about how he had been plagiarised," a woman who saw the man being detained told reporters.The explosive fire killed 33 people and 10 more are in critical condition, authorities said. It marks the worst mass killing since a suspected arson attack in Tokyo killed 44 people in 2001.Aoba was believed to have bought two 20-litre gasoline cans at a hardware store and prepared the petrol in a park near the studio, Nippon TV said.He travelled to the area by train, the broadcaster said.NHK showed footage of him lying on his back as he spoke to a police officer at the time of his detention, shoeless and with apparent burns on his right leg below the knee.He had no connection with Kyoto Animation and his driver's licence gave an address in the north Tokyo suburb of Saitama, about 480km east of Kyoto, NHK said.None of the victims' identities had been disclosed as of Friday. There were 74 people inside the building when the fire started, Kyodo News reported.BODIES PILED UPThe building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants, though it was not legally required to by the fire code, a Kyoto Fire Department official said.Nineteen of the 33 who died were found on a staircase leading up to the roof from the third floor, bodies piled on top of each other, Kyodo News reported, citing authorities.Firefighters arriving soon after the fire began found the door to the roof was shut but could be opened from the outside, the news agency said.The victims may have rushed up the stairs to escape the blaze and found themselves unable to open the door, it added.The fire wasn't put out until early Friday morning.Police investigators searched the smouldering shell of the building for evidence in an investigation that covered suspected arson, murder and attempted murder, Kyodo News reported.Two petrol cans, a rucksack and a trolley were found near the site, and television images showed what appeared to be five long knives laid out by police as possible evidence outside the three-storey building.Kyoto Animation, in a quiet suburb about 20 minutes by train from the centre of Kyoto, produces popular "anime" series such as the Sound!

The democratic socialist candidate is under attack from the super rich, their corporations, lobbyists, and think tanks. Some are even backing his 2020 Democratic primary rivals.by 
    Michael Sainato July 19, 20196:00 AMAccording to Forbes, there were 607 billionaires in the United States as of the end of 2018, an increase of more than 200 since 2010. And many of them going on the attack against Bernie Sanders’ 2020 Presidential Campaign, and his commitment to democratic socialism. As the primary season heats up, billionaires have appeared in major media outlets criticizing the candidate and especially his ideas. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for example, recently denounced on CBS news the idea of socialism, a sentiment also expressed by fellow billionaires Mark Cuban, Ken Griffin (who called socialism “soaking the rich,”) and Elon Musk (who said he actually was a socialist—just the kind that “seeks greatest good for all.”) Former Goldman Sachs CEO and billionaire Lloyd Blankfein criticized Sanders in a February 2019 defense of stock buybacks and cuts to Social Security. DonkeyHotey / GoodFreePhotosIn a Fox Business interview on June 24, the founders of Home Depot, Bernie Marcus and Ken Langone, called Sanders “the enemy of every entrepreneur,” claiming his influence would make the United States poor like Venezuela. In a June 20, 2019, interview with CNBC, billionaire Leon Cooperman claimed “Sanders doesn’t have a clue,” and that Democrats moving left in 2020 will hurt stocks. On June 7, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC that stocks would fall 30 to 40 percent if Bernie were elected President. Three days later, billionaire Democratic donor Haim Saban told the Hollywood Reporter that he likes all the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates except Sanders, who he claimed is a communist and a “disaster zone.” Billionaire Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO, warned that Democrats nominating a “far-left person” in 2020 will guarantee Trump’s re-election. The centrist think tank, Third Way—funded by lobbyists, Wall Street, and Republican donors—has claimed it will support any Democrat but Sanders.Other blowback has been less direct. Billionaire Jeff Bezos’ Amazon pushed back against Sanders’s criticisms of working conditions and low wages in Amazon warehouses. Last month, the billionaire Walton family’s retail giant Walmart rejected a shareholders proposal backed by Sanders to give workers a voice on the company’s executive board. Sanders’s proposals for forgiving student debt, Medicare for All, and free college tuition, among others, have been ridiculed, dismissed, and heavily opposed by Wall Street investors, the health insurance industry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Billionaire funded conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and the American Enterprise Institute, regularly publish and promote hit pieces on Sanders and his progressive policies.Some billionaires have focused on backing Sanders’s rivals in the 2020 Democratic primaries by hosting fundraising galas or donating the maximum allowable contributions to their campaigns. Billionaire Linked-In founder Reid Hoffman hosted a recent fundraiser for Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has also received maximum $2,800 donations from billionaires Donald Sussman, Carrie Walton-Penner, Marc Benioff, Leonard Lauder, Eric Schmidt, Bill & Melinda Gates, and Seth Klarman.In May 2019, Senator Kamala Harris received several maximum donations from members of the billionaire oil baron Getty family who have hosted fundraisers for her campaign, as has billionaire banker Ronald Perelman. Billionaires Laurene Powell Jobs, Marc Benioff, Laura Lauder, Steve Cohen, Diane Wilsey, Marsha Laufer, and several family members of the real estate billionaire Tsakopoulous family have given maximum contributions to Harris.Billionaire investor Gerry Schwartz is hosting a fundraiser for Pete Buttigieg at his Nantucket home on July 6. Buttigieg has also held fundraisers hosted by the son of real-estate billionaire Steven Roth and received financial support from billionaires James Murdoch, Deborah Simon, several members of the billionaire Pohlad family, Gabriela Hearst, Isaac Pritzker, and Rosemary Pritzker. Billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Chanos has hosted at least one fundraiser for Joe Biden, and Republican billionaire donor John Catsimatidis has offered support for Biden’s bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination, though he declined to donate monetarily. Due to Biden’s late presidential announcement and filing, FEC data for his campaign is not yet available, but he’s made it clear to billionaires he has no plans to challenge their immense, concentrated wealth. Sanders has embraced the opposition he's received from billionaires and the ultra wealthy.Sanders, who has sworn off private lavish fundraising events with wealthy donors throughout the primaries and general election, has embraced the opposition he’s received from billionaires and the ultra wealthy. His rhetoric of railing against income and wealth inequality and the political influence of wealthy donors and corporations has increasingly become popularized in Democratic Party messaging. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also embraced the strategy of taking billionaires on and embracing their criticism. She’s proposed increased taxes on billionaires, laughed off criticism from billionaires like former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and the vulture hedge fund billionaire who owns Sears, Eddie Lampert, and targeted the billionaire Sandler family for its role in perpetuating the opioid crisis. Billionaire and prolific Republican donor Ken Griffin has also criticized Warren in media interviews, and billionaire former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed her proposal for an annual wealth tax is probably unconstitutional and compared it to Venezuela.  Most recently, in an interview with Fox News, billionaire Peter Thiel said he’s most afraid of Warren’s candidacy among the 2020 Democratic Presidential candidates. Rather than embrace socialism, Warren has demonstrated some caution in arguing that capitalism needs better regulation and enforcement. In terms of fighting the role of corporate and ultra wealthy influences on politics, she has only sworn off high dollar fundraisers for the primary race, not the general election, and held high-dollar fundraiser events prior to her campaign launch in 2018, including one hosted by Nasdaq Vice Chairman Meyer Frucher. She’s also agreed to headline an upcoming DNC fundraiser for the eventual nominee, with VIP tickets reaching $50,000, and her campaign reportedly asked wealthy donors to cover her voter database fees. But Sanders continues to differentiate himself from the field by taking on the billionaires and the ultra wealthy several steps further than his rivals, many of whom are reluctant to vigorously support progressive solutions he’s helped move into the mainstream. In a recent speech on democratic socialism, Sanders quoted President Franklin Delano Roosevelt railing against the wealthy and powerful: “They are unanimous in their hate for me and I welcome their hatred.”Michael Sainato is a journalist based in Gainesville, Florida.

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat die als rassistisch kritisierten Attacken von US-Präsident Donald Trump gegen Demokratinnen verurteilt. "Ich distanziere mich davon entschieden und fühle mich solidarisch mit den drei attackierten Frauen", sagte Merkel bei ihrer Sommerpressekonferenz. 
In einem Tweet hatte Trump mehrere Demokratinnen dazu aufgefordert, in ihre vermeintlichen Heimatländer zurückzugehen und die Probleme dort zu lösen, statt den USA gute Ratschläge zu geben. Rassismusvorwürfe wies er von sich. Die vier Politikerinnen sind alle US-Bürgerinnen. Drei sind in den USA geboren, eine kam in Somalia auf die Welt, wurde aber schon als Teenagerin in den USA eingebürgert.
Merkel sagte, Menschen ganz unterschiedlicher Nationalität hätten zur Stärke der USA beigetragen. Trumps Äußerungen liefen ihrem Eindruck zuwider und konterkarierten die Stärke Amerikas.
Auf europäischer Ebene will Merkel über die Verteilung von Geflüchteten nicht länger in Einzelfällen entscheiden. Es gehe darum, nicht "ad hoc bei jedem Schiff eine Einzellösung zu finden", sagte Merkel bei einer Pressekonferenz. Sie hoffe sehr, dass es bis zur Reform der Dublin-Regelungen "einen zeitlich befristeten Mechanismus" zur Rettung und Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen gebe. "Seenotrettung ist für uns nicht nur Verpflichtung, sondern ein Gebot der Humanität."
Die designierte EU-Kommissionspräsidentin Ursula von der Leyen hatte zuvor in einem Interview angekündigt, Konstruktionsfehler bei den Dublin-Regeln beheben zu wollen. "Ich habe nie wirklich verstanden, warum Dublin mit der einfachen Gleichung begann: Wo ein Migrant zuerst europäischen Boden betritt, muss er oder sie bleiben", sagte von der Leyen der Bild-Zeitung.
Nach den Dublin-Regeln ist das Land für Schutzsuchende zuständig, in dem sie zuerst europäischen Boden betreten haben. Migranten, die unerlaubt weiterreisen, können in ihr Ankunftsland zurückgeschickt werden. In der Praxis gelingt es aber oft nicht, die Betroffenen innerhalb der dafür vorgesehenen sechs Monate zurückzubringen.
Die große Koalition sieht Merkel noch nicht am Ende. "Wir haben gezeigt, dass wir handlungsfähig sind, obwohl wir viele Meinungsverschiedenheiten überbrücken müssen." Vor der Koalition stünden noch "eine Vielzahl von Aufgaben", sagte Merkel. Als Beispiele nannte sie den geplanten Abbau des Solidaritätszuschlags für 90 Prozent der Bürger, die Grundrente und ein weiteres Bürokratie-Entlastungsgesetz. Hier würden in den kommenden Monaten Entwürfe vorgelegt werden.
Trotz schwächerer Konjunkturaussichten will die Bundeskanzlerin an der "schwarzen Null", einem ausgeglichenen Haushalt ohne Neuverschuldung, festhalten. "Wir haben in Deutschland ein Durchschnittsalter von 45 Lebensjahren. Damit gehören wir mit zu den ältesten Ländern der Welt." Sie halte es für wichtig, die immer weniger jungen Menschen nicht mit immer weiter wachsenden Schulden in die Zukunft zu schicken. Merkel verwies dabei auch auf die Schuldenbremse im Grundgesetz und darauf, dass die Bundesländer sich nicht mehr verschulden dürfen. 
Die Klimaaktivistin Greta Thunberg und die Bewegung Fridays for Future hätten die Umweltpolitik der Bundesregierung vorangebracht. "Sie haben uns sicherlich zur Beschleunigung getrieben", sagte Merkel. "Außerordentliche Wetterverläufe" zeigten, welche Schäden ein Nichthandeln in der Klimapolitik mit sich brächten. Der effizienteste Weg für Deutschland, seine Klimaziele 2030 zu erreichen, sei ein CO2-Preis. 
Schön, aber zu spät und wird auch nicht passieren.Wie kommt Merkel denn ausgerechnet jetzt darauf?Entfernt. Bitte bleiben Sie beim Thema. Danke, die Redaktion/rcMal rein hypothetisch sollte eine solche Verteilungseinigung erzielt werden, wie wird dann gewährleistet, dass keine Binnenmigration z.B. nach Deutschland stattfindet? Meldeauflagen? Grenzkontrollen?Was ist das Problem wenn sie das Geld aus z.B. Polen in Deutschland ausgeben?Für mich sind das einfach nur hohle Phrasen, die keinem schaden aber auch niemanden helfen. Allenfalls hören sich diese Worte nur schön an, ersetzen aber keine kostruktiven Vorschläge."Für mich sind das einfach nur hohle Phrasen"Sie haben den Job einer Bundeskanzlerin einfach nicht verstanden.Entfernt. Bitte verzichten Sie auf überzogene Polemik. Danke, die Redaktion/rcEntfernt. Der Bezugskommentar wurde bereits entfernt. Danke, die Redaktion/rc

AdvertisementSupported byBy Melissa EddyBERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany expressed solidarity on Friday with the four Democratic congresswomen whom President Trump told to “go back” to the countries they came from, saying the remarks ran counter to her impression of what makes America strong.Speaking to reporters in Berlin on Friday at her annual summer news conference, the chancellor fielded questions on a broad range of topics, but was asked repeatedly about her position regarding Mr. Trump’s insults to the congresswomen.The House of Representatives has voted to condemn the president’s remarks as racist, and many world leaders have offered rebukes in recent days, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain told Parliament this week that she “strongly condemned those comments made by President Trump.”Ms. Merkel has been critical of Mr. Trump since the day after he was elected, when she pointedly reminded him that Germany and the United States were bound by their common values of “democracy, freedom, the respect for the law and dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political beliefs.”Asked whether she still stood behind that statement of shared values after Mr. Trump’s remarks, Ms. Merkel said: “People of very different nationalities have contributed to the strength of the American people.” She added that the president’s comments “very much run counter to this firm impression that I have.”Pressed on whether she supported the four congresswomen — Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — the chancellor said, “Yes.”She added that she “feels solidarity” with the “women who were attacked.”Ms. Merkel, who began a fourth term as chancellor of Europe’s largest economy in 2017, also laid out ambitious plans to revive her country’s struggling efforts to meet its goals to help combat climate change, an effort that she credited partially to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and her mobilization of students across the globe.“They certainly drove us to speed up,” Ms. Merkel said. “The seriousness with which Greta, but also many, many other young people, are telling us that this is about their lives, and that their life spans extend further, has led us to approach the matter more resolutely.”She said that her government planned to lay out a new climate law in September and that it was expected to include a carbon pricing mechanism, as well as the structures for exiting coal by 2038. Despite early attempts to transform its economy to one powered by green energy, Germany will miss its 2020 targets for reducing greenhouse gasses, largely because of its reliance on abundant, cheap coal.Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement


I thought I hated Nixon. I thought I hated Reagan. I thought I hated Bush and Cheney.In fact, I had no idea what the word meant. I do now. Living in New York in the 1980s, I got enough news of Donald Trump to realize he was unique in his noxious preposterousness, and I was far from alone in that conclusion. Kurt Andersen and Graydon Carter, then editors of the satirical monthly magazine Spy, recognized instantly that this belligerent boor epitomized the very worst of humanity, and humiliating him became their greatest pleasure.But back in those innocent days, none of us could have imagined that this “short-fingered vulgarian,” as they so perfectly dubbed him, would go from local buffoon to global menace.In the good old days — that is, before Trump’s infamous escalator ride on June 16, 2015, to announce his presidential bid — those of us for whom politics was sport had the luxury of wallowing for a week or more in the muck of a single callous remark by Ed Meese during the Reagan years, or the premature announcement of an accomplished mission by George W. Bush, or any other of the tens of thousands of offensive, moronic or just plain absurd words and deeds perpetrated on us by those in power.Thirty years ago, I could compile all eight years of the worst of Reagan and his minions into a slim, 288-page book, “The Clothes Have No Emperor.” To chronicle all of the idiocy, greed and cruelty we’ve been subjected to by Trump and his henchmen, we would need a book the size of the OED.I used to take perverse pleasure in unearthing the periodic stupefying quotes of our leaders buried at the bottom of the jump pages in newspapers. Now I struggle to keep up with a tsunami of sewage. It is a wearying task, performed to a depressing background chorus constantly running in my brain: “Donald Trump is our president.”For two years despair could be kept at bay by the possibility that Robert Mueller would save us, that there was an end in sight. Now all we are left with is the hope that the wimpiest political party the country has ever seen can somehow wrest back power.The preternatural timidity of the Democrats is as responsible for the country’s demise as the rapaciousness of the Republicans. As far apart as they are on the human spectrum, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch “Yertle” McConnell share the repugnant instinct to put party over country. All of the things we always counted on to save us — truth, the law, common decency — have been obliterated.And now we have to deal with the most ominous development yet: disinformation, in all its insidious forms. Technology has annihilated authenticity. Even if YouTube and all of the social media forums were dedicated to eradicating this scourge, the disease cannot be cured. As H.R. Haldeman of Watergate fame said, back in the day when a single quote could stand the test of time instead of being washed away in hours by something new, “Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in.”People believe what they want to believe. The truth sinks into the quicksand of lies. Yes, right-wing radio and Fox News and the internet set all of this in motion, but no one could have dreamed up a better character than Trump to bring the temple down.With Democrats refusing to do their constitutional duty, the certainty that this monstrous spectacle will last at least through 2020 — and, unthinkably, maybe through 2024 — puts us at a crossroads. How much more time can we give over to studying this odious excuse for a human?Scott Jennings: Dear liberals, your outrage helps Trump far more than it hurts him »We’ve already seen everything there is to see. There will never be anything new, only more of the same. (Another wildly credible rape charge? Ho hum. More shady business dealings? Yawn.) No matter how hideous the next thing he does, no matter how furious it makes us, no matter how much more it makes us despise him, there will be nothing surprising about any of it.It’s time, therefore, to reclaim our lives. We have OD’d on a radioactively toxic drug, and though going cold turkey will likely be impossible, withdrawal is essential.For me that means no more nanosecond-by-nanosecond monitoring of CNN or MSNBC unless there is actual news. No Brooke Baldwin, no Jake Tapper, no Nicolle Wallace, no Chris Matthews, no Rachel Maddow, no Lawrence O’Donnell. (Well, OK, maybe Lawrence.) Unless and until impeachment starts, there’s nothing happening I need to know about instantly.I will be informed by Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver and Samantha Bee, and online by Charles Pierce, Wonkette and my favorites on social media. I’ll continue to share the best of what I come across on Facebook and Twitter, because I get pleasure from these confirmations of my sanity. I will still comment on friends’ posts and tweets, because I enjoy the conversation. But neither President Thug nor the Democrats’ craven gutlessness will get my constant attention. There are too many TV shows, too many books, too much music to catch up on. Life is too short to devote so much of it to obsessing about this racist ignoramus.When we think about him, he wins.

 Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  One of the byproducts of President Trump’s norm-busting presidency is that things that used to be regarded as beyond the pale are suddenly normalized. With the envelope being pushed so far and the larger provocations dominating the news, lesser ones slip by largely unnoticed.Such is the case with Trump’s “go back” rhetoric and the “send her back” chants it spawned. While our focus has been trained on whether it’s okay to hint that political opponents should leave the country, Trump and his fellow Republicans have sneaked a Trojan horse of a talking point into the 2020 debate.That talking point: that their Democratic opponents are anti-American.One of the first members to criticize the “send her back” chants about Somali American Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) Wednesday night in North Carolina was Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.). But even while he tweeted that the chants were “painful to our friends in the minority communities,” he qualified it by saying that Omar’s “history, words & actions reveal her great disdain for both America & Israel.” Though it was brief, I struggled with the “send her back” chant tonight referencing Rep. Omar. Her history, words & actions reveal her great disdain for both America & Israel. That should be our focus and not phrasing that’s painful to our friends in the minority communities.Calling for the deportation of lawful American citizens who have committed no crimes? That’s bad. Saying they hate this country? That’s apparently okay — even in the same breath.The Walker tweet, better than anything, shows just how concerted the GOP effort is to insert this once-eschewed attack line into the 2020 debate.Trump laid the groundwork in his tweets Sunday that launched the current controversy, labeling the four nonwhite Democratic freshman congresswomen “anti-Semitic” and “anti-America.” By Monday morning, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested Trump should “aim higher” and not attack people personally, but he also said these members “hate our own country” and are “anti-America.” (Nothing personal about that, apparently.)Some have been more careful to label the members comments and positions as anti-American, rather than them personally. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said “many of the things that has come out of the mouths of these four freshman congresswomen is offensive, it is anti-American.” Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R-Wis.) caused a stir on the House floor by mentioning the “anti-American” portion of Trump’s tweet, which Democrats argued violated rules against personal attacks. He later clarified that he was referring to “anti-American comments.” “I’ve never called them anti-American,” Duffy assured.But others haven’t been so shy.“The people of Alabama have had enough watching the anti-Semitic, anti-American, socialist Dems degrade our nation,” Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) tweeted.“Montanans are sick and tired of listening to anti-American, anti-Semite, radical Democrats trash our country and our ideals,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) added in a tweet that earned a retweet from Trump.A member of House Republican leadership, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), even referred to the “anti-American and anti-Semitic wing of” the Democratic Party.While Democrats push radical socialist policies to destroy America and prop up the anti-American and anti-Semitic wing of their party, @realDonaldTrump is working to grow our economy, secure our southern border, and tackle the actual issues hardworking families are facing. pic.twitter.com/xGqpQr9yqyThis is the kind of thing politicians used to not say. Whatever your policy disagreements, you didn’t suggest your opponents were unpatriotic or opposed to their country. That’s not to say nobody ever uttered such phrases, but when they did, it wasn’t just glossed over like it is now.Back in 2008, then-Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) suggested Barack Obama “may have anti-American views.” It was such a big deal that Bachmann apologized, apparently fearing for her reelection. And that was just talking about Obama’s views — not him personally.By 2015, Rudolph W. Giuliani was barking up a similar tree, saying he didn’t believe Obama “loves America.” Many top Republicans raised concerns, including top potential 2016 presidential candidates.Among them? Now-Vice President Pence, who said, “I don’t think it helps to question the president’s patriotism or motives,” and Graham, who defended Obama by saying, “I have no doubt that he loves his country, I have no doubt that he’s a patriot.” Apparently that doesn’t apply to Omar and the Democrats in 2019.

When it comes to political ads on Facebook, President Trump is still outspending all of his Democratic rivals by millions of dollars. But he's avoiding many of the issues that they're focused on to instead spend heavily on immigration messaging.Why it matters: Trump knows that in order to win again in 2020, he needs to target two populations: older, white voters and Hispanic voters and the way he targets Facebook advertising by topic reflects that approach.Driving the news: From March 30th until July 6th, President Trump has outspent his 2020 Democratic rivals combined roughly 3.45:1 on Facebook advertising around immigration issues, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive.While many of Trump's Facebook ads focus on fear-mongering around immigration, others do the exact opposite, and try to actually lure minority voters. Between the lines: Both advertising campaigns appear to mostly target older populations. Axios has previously reported that many of Trump's Facebook ads use nativist language and target seniors.Be smart: For the Democrats, messaging is all about owning your policy priorities, or your attack plan. The big picture: Digital ad campaigns, especially on Facebook, are often used this early in the cycle to build lists and to raise small-dollar fundraising. Hyper-targeting a message to reach a specific audience is often the most effective way to solicit engagement. Go deeper: Another Trump Facebook election


A Navya SAS autonomous bus is pictured undergoing testing on a closed test circuit.VIENNA -- Authorities are investigating why a driverless bus struck a pedestrian in Vienna, an incident that resulted in minor injuries but stopped Austrian trials of the technology.The Navya SAS vehicle was driving at 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) an hour on Thursday when it struck a 30-year-old woman in the knee, according to state broadcaster ORF.Vienna's transit authority suspended further trials pending outcome of the investigation.The city has been testing two driverless buses under a program that began June 6.The Austrian Institute of Technology and Siemens mobility are also participating in the project, which required a professional driver on board when the units were operating.Europe Breaking News Alerts (as needed)Europe Daily Summary (weekdays)Europe E-Magazine (monthly)Automotive News China Newsletter (twice weekly)Please enter a valid email address.Please enter your email address.Please select at least one newsletter to subscribe.You can unsubscribe at any time through links in these emails.

 Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  Last month, Walter Lübcke, a conservative German politician who supported Angela Merkel’s pro-refugee policy, was fatally shot in the head by a far-right terrorist. The suspect has ties to neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists, and in 1992, he nearly stabbed an immigrant to death. Lübcke was probably targeted for his support of refugees; he received a barrage of right-wing criticism online.Many people think that more immigration into Western countries leads to more terrorism, because immigrants from non-Western cultures are more likely to be terrorists. My research finds a very different kind of relationship. Immigrants aren’t committing terrorism in Western Europe. Rather, native citizens appear to be committing terrorism because of their hostility to immigrants.My study, published in the Journal of Global Security Studies, argues that grievances toward immigrants plausibly drive right-wing attacks. I began investigating this issue by studying the relationship between immigration and terrorism over the past couple decades in eight Western European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. I quickly found a strong pattern: When immigration levels to a country increase, the total number of terrorist attacks increased in that country as well.At first glance, this might suggest that immigrants are committing the terrorist attacks. Determining whether that is true required digging into the data. Fortunately, the available data on terrorist attacks usually includes some information on the group or individual responsible for the act. The data set used for the main analysis is the Terrorism in Western Europe: Event Data (TWEED) data set, which uses newspaper reporting to create a list of terrorist attacks in Western Europe for five decades. This enabled me to see whether there was a relationship between immigration and all forms of terrorism, or if the ideology of the terrorist mattered. I use TWEED’s definition of terrorism as politically motivated violence against civilians.After a closer examination of the data, I found this association is only present when looking at terrorist attacks by right-wing groups and individuals. There is no association between immigration and other forms of terrorism, including left-wing terrorism and terrorism by separatist groups, such as the IRA or ETA, the Basque separatist group. I found a similar relationship when using other data sets and measures of right-wing terrorism.[The Christchurch mosque shooting and the rise of the far right]Many people think that increased immigration drives competition for jobs. This might explain terrorism, if right-wing terrorists are driven to commit violent acts by economic anxieties caused by increasing immigration. However, there is little evidence that this is the case. Immigration levels are more closely associated with right-wing terrorism than measures related to the economy, such as GDP and the unemployment rate. Refugees, who are less likely to drive up the competition for jobs, are also associated with right-wing terrorism.This suggests that those on the far right commit terrorist attacks when there are more immigrants because they resent the increases in immigration. Moreover, many right-wing terrorist attacks are against immigrants themselves. More immigrants offer more targets for right-wing terrorism. Right-wing terrorism is quite frequent, both in the United States and Europe. While Walter Lübcke’s killing made headlines, many attacks against immigrants by right-wing terrorists occur with little coverage in international newspapers.Notably, this relationship is stronger when the immigrants come from Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing terrorism does not seem to rise when there is higher immigration from other European countries. Other research shows individual support for far-right parties and policies increases when someone has more resentment against immigrants. All of this suggests right-wing terrorism is a reaction to an out-group.Consider, for example, the data on Germany. From 2008 to 2015, according to the Global Terrorism Database, there were 86 terrorist attacks in Germany. Looking deeper into each one of these attacks, I find 60 of them could reasonably be described as right-wing terrorism. These attacks were more likely to be present in areas where a higher share of the population is foreign-born. Many of these attacks were directed against immigrants or against public housing dedicated to asylum seekers. The assassination of Lübcke is in keeping with this broad pattern.[Which right-wing online commenters are likely to become violent?]Many social scientists view terrorism as a tool used by groups to further their political goals. My findings suggest some forms of terrorism may simply be the product of cultural grievances on the part of people who have been radicalized politically, as in the Christchurch mosque terrorist attack, Quebec City mosque attack and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.This matters. There is little evidence to support the common claim that letting in more immigrants means letting in more terrorists. Furthermore, political rhetoric condemning immigrants may potentially stoke violence. Before Lübcke’s assassination, the far right launched a torrent of online abuse and death threats, including one by Lübcke’s assassin in a YouTube comment attacking Lübcke’s pro-refugee policy.Immigrants don’t pose a security risk. Rather, right-wing extremists who hate immigrants increase the threat of terrorism.Don’t miss anything! Sign up to get TMC’s smart analysis in your inbox, three days a week.Richard J.

 Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  The allegations against Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló make him look like a villainous politician straight out of a cartoon: He participated in profane chats that made light of dead Hurricane Maria victims, and there are corruption charges against his administration officials. And now tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, many of whom are already frustrated with life on an island still struggling to recover from financial crisis and natural disaster, want him out.They’ve spent much of the past few days protesting in the streets of San Juan and in Puerto Rican strongholds such as New York City and Barcelona, with celebrities such as singer Ricky Martin headlining what is fast becoming the largest modern political demonstration in the U.S. territory’s history. (Martin is a central part of this story — more on that later.)[Puerto Rico is in chaos, and some worry continued instability is a major threat]But even as they protest for their governor’s ouster, Puerto Ricans could be the ones most wounded by the scandal, left behind without leadership and without a federal government willing to help it recover from the hurricane and decades of mismanagement.Here’s a primer on what’s going on there.They are the spark that lit the fuse. On Saturday, the Puerto Rican nonprofit Center for Investigative Journalism published 889 pages of private chats between Rosselló and his officials and aides from last year, conversations conducted over the messaging app Telegram. All men, they made misogynistic jokes, made fun of gay people, insulted journalists, joked about shooting San Juan’s female mayor, made light of Hurricane Maria victims, and joked about the weight of a citizen with whom the governor posed in a photo.CNN’s Ricky Sanchez did a good job of highlighting and translating some of the most jaw-dropping chats from various officials close to the governor. Such as:On Hurricane Maria victims: “Now that we are on the subject, don’t we have some cadavers to feed our crows?” On Martin: One chat called him a “male chauvinist” and used vulgar language to say that Martin is gay “because women don’t measure up. Pure patriarchy.” (In response to this, in Puerto Rico, the chats have been dubbed by some as “Chatgate or “Rickyleaks,” the Associated Press reports. “It’s pretty much barbaric what he’s doing,” Martin told “CBS This Morning.” “We’re tired. We’re angry.”)On San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz: “I am salivating to shoot her.” (“You’d be doing me a grand favor,” the governor replied.)Thousands started protesting in San Juan, the capital, almost immediately. By Wednesday, an estimated 75,000 people marched in San Juan, calling for the governor’s ouster, reported “CBS This Morning.” Some of the protests turned violent during the night.With police still on the scene, and protesters gone this was our story from San Juan, Puerto Rico for @cbsthismorning telling a story to the nation that millions of Puerto Ricans want people to hear, staying with their Governor @ricardorossello pic.twitter.com/tzX7wGElZoAfter the chats leaked, the governor apologized and said by way of explanation that there were days he and his aides had worked “18 hours” and were tired. But he has refused calls to resign, even as members of his own party, the New Progressive Party, turn against him in Puerto Rico’s legislature. Some are openly talking about considering impeachment.Last week, the FBI arrested some Rosselló officials, including the secretary of education, on charges related to fraud involving $15.5 million in federal funds that prosecutors say went to companies they were friendly with.Puerto Rico has also declared bankruptcy, with an oversight board installed by the U.S. government now managing the island’s finances.And the island is still struggling to recover from a devastating hurricane. About 3,000 people died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria, and governments at all levels — including in Washington — have been criticized for their sluggish response. Thousands of people still live under blue tarps rather than roofs, The Washington Post reported.Congress approved $40 billion in aid after the storm, but Puerto Ricans have lost confidence they’ll see that money, stuck in a bureaucratic pipeline from Washington to San Juan.[The politics of disaster aid, explained]Oh, and others involved in the chat, including Puerto Rico’s secretary of state — who would be next in line for the island’s top job — resigned, raising the question of what would happen if Rosselló did go.Also, hurricane season is starting up.This all fits neatly into President Trump’s narrative of Puerto Rico. His administration has been accused of prioritizing Puerto Rico’s hurricane recovery below recovery from hurricanes that hit U.S. states around the same time, including by a majority of Puerto Ricans.But he’s pointed the finger back at Puerto Rico’s government. He started a feud with San Juan’s mayor, said his administration did a “fantastic job,” and now is all in on highlighting this latest controversy — calling the government “corrupt” in a Thursday tweet and incorrectly saying Congress gave Puerto Rico $92 billion.What’s most worrisome for Puerto Ricans though is how Trump said Congress “foolishly” gave Puerto Rico the money, suggesting that the island under Rosselló didn’t deserve substantial aid from the hurricane.....of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again. This is more than twice the amount given to Texas & Florida combined. I know the people of Puerto Rico well, and they are great. But much of their leadership is corrupt, & robbing the U.S. Government blind!That’s a dangerous thought for many Puerto Ricans. As The Post’s Arelis R. Hernández and Jeff Stein report, some powerful lawmakers in Congress are considering what they can do to put tighter restrictions on federal funding to Puerto Rico.As public school teacher Rafael Capo Garcia told Hernández so succinctly: “I’m worried that people will think Puerto Ricans cannot govern themselves.”


Polish weekly newspaper Gazeta Polska announced on July 17 that it will give away ‘LGBT-free zone’ stickers with its next issue, depicting a black cross over a rainbow. The newspaper is openly supportive of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) and appeals to a conservative, right-wing readership.The move has caused an understandable outcry, and has been labelled by many as homophobic, intolerant and even Hitler-esque. The deputy mayor of Warsaw, Paweł Rabiej, said that “the German fascists created zones free of Jews”, adding that he would make a complaint to the public prosecutors office. The US ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher also registered disapproval.“I am disappointed and concerned that some groups use stickers to promote hatred and intolerance,” she tweeted on July 18. “We respect freedom of speech, but we must stand together on the side of values such as diversity and tolerance.”Rival newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza came out in support of the LGBT community. “Poland is for all its citizens. No one has the right to designate exclusion zones for any reason. There is no consent for a new apartheid. Defend human and citizen rights.”Instagram removed Gazeta Polska’s post about the stickers citing it as hate speech, yet the newspaper shows no signs of backing down. Speaking live on Telewizja Republika the editor of the paper Tomasz Sakiewicz argued: “The symbol of LGBT today is beginning to be associated with what a sickle and hammer or swastika was. Perhaps they are motivated by good intentions. Communists also had good intentions. Very often behind good ideas are good intentions.” He later stated that rather than showing intolerance, the stickers in fact promote tolerance of ‘traditional Polish values’ which are being threatened by the LGBT movement. “This label is a sign of opposition not to specific people, but to a radically leftist ideology reconciling the family and values on which European civilisation has been based for centuries.”The newspaper, which has a circulation of around 110,000, will hit vendors on July 24. You must be logged in to post a comment.Connect with us through social media.We use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, analyze site traffic, personalize content, and serve targeted advertisements.

On July 9, John Delaney's senior team sat him down and told him to drop out of the presidential race by mid-August, according to three sources close to the campaign.Why it matters: He's been running for president for 721 days. He's spent nearly $19 million as a 2020 candidate since 2017. He's loaned over $11 million of his own money to his campaign this year. He's visited all of Iowa's 99 counties already, including at least 14 stops in Carroll Country alone. And it's all been for nothing.“I think a lot of people who did leave thought, 'You gotta eat. You need a paycheck.' So that was a big part of it,” said a former staffer.The backdrop: Those close to him think there's no chance he makes the September debates, which have a harder qualification threshold than the first two.One source familiar with the meeting said Delaney seemed open to the idea of dropping out later this summer, but that he'd still attend the next debates in Detroit July 30-31.Between the lines: The tension between Delaney and his staff comes from a larger feeling that he's been easily influenced by "outside" forces, like his wife or his friends, rather than his own staff.Yes, but: Not all was bad. Ahmed El-Sayed who worked with Delaney's campaign in various capacities through the end of May, said "he’d make a really good president. ... He’s probably one of the smartest people I’ve met."FWIW: Delaney has been polling between 0% and 1% since the beginning of 2017.


When Democrats are accused of anti-Semitism, Republicans understand that code language can be hurtful. But Trump’s racist comments get a pass.Most of the time, conservatives and Republicans want the bar for what constitutes bigotry to be set extremely high. When President Donald Trump tweeted last weekend that four nonwhite Democrats in Congress should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” he offered a textbook example of racism. Trump’s own Equal Employment Opportunity Commission uses the phrase Go back to where you came from as one of its examples of discrimination based on national origin. Yet Trump insisted that “those Tweets were NOT Racist”—even as he doubled down on them by launching an attack on Representative Ilhan Omar that prompted rally-goers in North Carolina on Wednesday night to chant “Send her back!”At the same time that Trump was denying charges of bigotry, however, he was also leveling them. At the North Carolina rally, he accused Omar of “vicious anti-Semitic” remarks—a reference to her tweet that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s influence in Washington is “all about the Benjamins” and her allegation that pro-Israel groups “push for allegiance to a foreign country.” Those comments—which evoked hoary stereotypes of Jews as money-driven and disloyal—elicited criticism even from Democrats, and Omar apologized for the first. But however damning one considers her statements, it’s utterly illogical to claim that they constitute bigotry while Trump’s far more direct attack does not. Yet this is exactly what Trump and other prominent Republicans are doing.When Democrats are accused of prejudice against Jews, Republicans can find it easy to discern ugly coded language. But when Trump and others in his party are accused of hostility to black people, Muslims, and Latinos, prominent conservatives set the standard for what constitutes bigotry so high that it’s almost impossible to meet.Consider the double standard that Republican politicians and conservative pundits have employed when responding to Trump’s tweets. “The president’s not a racist,” declared Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who then went on to condemn Omar for her “anti-Semitic tropes.” On Face the Nation, the Federalist editor Ben Domenech twice ducked the moderator’s questions about whether Trump’s tweets were racist but volunteered that Omar had engaged in “anti-Semitic speech.” At The Resurgent, Erick Erickson explained that while Trump’s tweet was “bad,” he would not succumb to “all the people demanding everyone stand up and scream that it is racist.” Then, having established his extreme reluctance to level accusations of bigotry, he declared that “multiple Democrats in the past year have made a host of anti-Semitic remarks.” Why did these unspecified remarks by unnamed Democrats merit a firm condemnation, but Trump’s remarks did not? Erickson didn’t say.Yet for intellectual inconsistency, even Domenech, Erickson, and McConnell couldn’t match Lindsey Graham. Trump’s tweets weren’t racist, Graham argued, because he hadn’t told all Somali Americans to go home, only Omar. “If you’re a Somali refugee who likes Trump,” Graham explained, “he’s not gonna say, ‘Go back to Somalia.’” But instead of looking for creative ways to exonerate Omar as well, Graham described not only her but also “AOC and this crowd” as “anti-Semitic.” What exactly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or for that matter Ayanna Pressley or Rashida Tlaib, had done to merit an accusation of bigotry was left unstated. Graham didn’t bother to specify.Obviously, this double standard stems in part from partisanship. If conservatives were motivated solely by concerns about anti-Semitism, they’d be outraged by Trump’s blatant insinuations that Jews are loyal to Israel and care only about money. In 2015, after all, Trump told a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money.” Speaking to the group this April, he called Benjamin Netanyahu “your prime minister.”But in addition to political calculation, the dramatic divergence between the way conservatives treat charges of racism and charges of anti-Semitism is also a product of selective empathy. Although most Jews vote Democratic, Jews are well represented in conservative and Republican circles. There is no African-American, Latino, or Muslim Republican group with anywhere near the prominence of the Republican Jewish Coalition. This proximity sensitizes conservatives to the anxieties of a least one wing of the American Jewish community in ways that doesn’t exist with most people of color.The radically different standard that American conservatives use to evaluate charges of bigotry against Trump and Omar has nothing to do with principle. It’s identity politics by another name. The harder Republicans work to find evidence of Democratic bigotry, the easier they make it for Trump to get away with his own.We want to hear what you think about this article.

AdvertisementClose XThe children were being sodomized in secret underground tunnels. Their captors drank blood in front of them and staged satanic ritual sacrifices. Sometimes the kids were filmed for pornographic purposes. In total, some several hundred children were subjected to this treatment. And it all happened in the middle of a safe neighborhood where crimes were not supposed to happen, let alone such unspeakable and horrific ones.Not that anyone else witnessed the abuse. Nor was there any clear evidence that it was actually happening. But people were sure it was real. It made too much sense, they all agreed. “Everything fell into place,” one of them said. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of otherwise normal, relatively well-adjusted Americans truly believed that a massive ring of occultist pedophiles was operating right under everyone’s noses.The McMartin preschool scandal of the 1980s was a sort of analog version of the more recent Pizzagate, part of a lurid and misbegotten moral panic about subterranean child abuse. Even though the supposed crimes unfolded thousands of miles and several decades apart, under very different circumstances, the two conspiracy theories share the same rough contours. The McMartin saga, which began in 1983 with accusations made by one boy’s mother, came to encompass fantastical claims about a massive pedophile ring lurking beneath a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California. Pizza­gate was concocted during the 2016 presidential campaign and alleged that prominent figures in the Democratic Party were running a child sex ring in tunnels beneath the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in a residential Washington, DC, neighborhood. Both spun off into new theories: Amid a full-on national hysteria, McMartin spawned a series of day-care conspiracies, while Pizzagate has led to QAnon, an even wilder conspiracy theory that postulates that President Donald Trump is on the verge of arresting a throng of liberal elites for facilitating and participating in a sprawling child sex ring. Both drew on natural fears about child safety and supercharged them into national phenomena with real-world ramifications. Both of course were fictions.Conspiracies centering on the vulnerability of children are neither new nor distinctly American. Wild claims of Jews killing Christian children and using their blood in rituals—the “blood libel”—date back to at least the 12th century and have popped up every so often since then, and long before that Christians were suspected of performing similar rites. “Hurting children is one of the worst things you can say someone is doing. It’s an easy way to demonize your enemy,” says Kathryn Olmsted, a professor of history at the University of California-Davis, who has studied conspiracy theories.Why do child-abuse conspiracies explode into public consciousness at certain moments? Explanations offered for the peculiar resonance of Pizzagate and QAnon tend to focus on pathologies in the media ecosystem—epistemic bubbles, polarization, the unruly growth of social media. But years before the fracturing of mass culture and the dawn of Reddit and 4chan, the McMartin accusations fed a national spectacle during which scores of people were wrongly accused of sex crimes against children.The continuities between the McMartin case and Pizzagate suggest a broader explanation for pedophile conspiracies: They aren’t the residue of malfunctions in our media culture. They’re an outgrowth of the normal workings of reactionary politics.Author Richard Beck, in We Believe the Children: A Moral Panic in the 1980s, locates the roots of the McMartin conspiracy theory in the social progress of the previous decade—particularly in the gains won by women. “In the ’80s you had a strong, vicious anti-­feminist backlash that helped conspiracies take hold,” Beck tells me. “In the ’70s, middle- and upper-middle-class women had started to enter the full-time workforce instead of being homemakers.” This was the dawn of what the economist Claudia Goldin has termed “the quiet revolution.” Thanks in part to expanding reproductive freedom, career horizons had widened sufficiently by the end of the 1970s for women to become, in Goldin’s words, “active participants who bargain somewhat effectively in the household and the labor market.” They were now forming their identities outside the context of the family and household.The patriarchal family was under siege, as conservatives saw it, and day-care centers had become the physical representation of the social forces bedeviling them. “You had this Reagan-­driven conservative resurgence,” Beck says, “and day care was seen as at least suspicious, if not an actively maligned force of feminism.”Day care held a prominent place in right-wing demonology. As far back as the 1960s, conservatives were warning darkly that child care “was a communist plot to destroy the traditional family,” as sociologist Jill Quadagno writes in The Color of Welfare. In 1971, President Richard Nixon vetoed the Comprehensive Child Development Act, which would’ve established a national day-care system. In his veto message, Nixon used the Red-baiting language urged upon him by his special assistant, Pat Buchanan, saying the program would’ve committed “the vast moral authority of the national government to the side of communal approaches to child-rearing against the family-centered approach.” In a decade of rising divorce rates, at least conspiracism and reactionary social conservatism could enjoy a happy marriage. By the time Judy Johnson came forward in 1983 with allegations that a teacher at the McMartin preschool had molested her child, the country had been primed to assume the worst by more than a decade of child-care fearmongering.Certainly it wasn’t just the movement of women into the workplace that created the conditions for a reactionary panic. There were other cultural forces at work. The anti-rape campaign of the 1970s, historian Philip Jenkins writes in Moral Panic, had “formulated the concepts and vocabulary that would become integral to child-protection ideology,” in particular a “refusal to disbelieve” victims. The repressed-­memory movement of that era had created a therapeutic consensus surrounding kids’ claims of molestation: “Be willing to believe the unbelievable,” as the self-help book The Courage to Heal put it. “Believe the survivor…No one fantasizes abuse.” And the anti-cult movement of the late 1970s had raised the specter of satanic cabals engaging in human sacrifice and other sinister behavior.Beck likens conspiracy theories to parables. The ones that stick are those that most effectively validate a group’s anxieties, with blame assigned to outsiders. In a 2017 paper on Pizzagate and pedophile conspiracies, psychology professor Jim Kline, now at Northern Marianas College, argues that conspiracy theories “are born during times of turmoil and uncertainty.” In an interview, Kline goes further: “Social turmoil can overwhelm critical thinking. It makes us get beyond what is logically possible. We go into this state of hysteria and we let that overwhelm ourselves.”The McMartin accusations were a vivid demonstration of the rot in the American social structure, as perceived by conservatives. Perhaps inevitably, the claims metastasized. Now it was hundreds of children who had been assaulted and subjected to satanic rituals, and now, instead of just one McMartin teacher, there was an entire sex ring involved. One boy told of adults in masks and black robes dancing and moaning; of live rabbits chopped to bits by candlelight. “California’s Nightmare Nursery,” People magazine called it. But soon the case began to fall apart. The stories of abuse turned out to have been coaxed out of children by way of dubious and leading questioning. Judy Johnson, who made the initial accusations that her son had been molested, was found to be a paranoid schizophrenic. In 1986, a district attorney dropped charges—at one point there had been 208 counts in all—against all but two of the original defendants. A pair of trials ended in 1990 with the juries deadlocking on some charges and acquitting on the others. After seven years and $15 million in prosecution costs, the remaining charges were dropped.However flimsy its premises, the case whipped up a national panic. In 1985, a teacher’s aide in Massachusetts was wrongly convicted of molesting 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old boys and girls; the prosecutor had told the jury that a gay man working in a day care was like a “chocoholic in a candy store.” Around that time, employees at Bronx day-care centers were arrested for allegedly sexually abusing children. Five men were sentenced before all ultimately saw their convictions overturned.Liberals certainly participated in the hysteria—Gloria Steinem donated money to the McMartin investigation—but by and large it was a reactionary phenomenon. What drove the panic, Beck says, wasn’t just the sense that children were being harmed. “It’s that families were being harmed.”In 2016, three decades after the McMartin trial, WikiLeaks, in cahoots with Russian hackers, published the private emails of top Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta. In one, Podesta is invited to a fundraiser at Comet Ping Pong. Amateur internet sleuths blew it up into a conspiracy theory about a child-sex ring. The pedophiles communicated in code: “hotdog” meant “young boy”; “cheese” meant “little girl”; “sauce” meant “orgy.” The theory was easily debunked. Eventually it was abandoned by the high-­profile internet figures who’d initially given it oxygen, but not before Pizzagate, as it was immediately dubbed, had spilled over into reality. In December 2016, a 28-year-old man named Edgar Maddison Welch, having driven from North Carolina to Washington, DC, fired an assault rifle inside Comet in a bid to rescue the children he thought were locked away there. No one was hurt. Welch was sentenced to four years in prison.The QAnon conspiracy picked up where Pizzagate left off, alleging that the liberal elite’s pedophile ring extends way beyond one restaurant and that it is only a matter of time before Trump arrests Podesta, Clinton, and other Democratic power brokers for their crimes. All of this was fueled by an anonymous internet poster dubbed Q, who claims to be a government insider.With Pizzagate and QAnon, the molesters have changed from day-care workers to the liberal elite, and the politics behind the theories now are more explicitly spelled out. But the general context is more or less the same: conservative retrenchment after a period of progressive social gains. If women’s entry into the workplace in the latter half of the 20th century triggered deep anxieties about the decay of traditional gender roles and the family unit, in the 21st century it was same-sex marriage, growing acceptance of transgender rights, and the seeming cultural hegemony of a social justice agenda. “Q found that fear,” says Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher and a host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast. “While Q directly never touches on trans rights or those sorts of things, there is a great deal of anxiety on those sorts of issues,” he says, referring to the QAnon community at large. “They’re concerned generally on the sort of accep­tance of trans people and the oversexualization of children.” On the matter of transgender rights, the conspiracists are aligned with “normal” conservative politics; from the state legislatures to the White House, Repub­licans have made considerable hay out of attacking and overturning various protections that had been extended to trans people.Conspiracy theories of all kinds draw their energy from social anxieties. Occasionally there is some real basis for the theories. In her book, Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power, Anna Merlan details the belief among black New Orleanians after Hurricane Katrina that the city’s levees hadn’t failed on their own—they had been bombed intentionally to destroy the poor parts of New Orleans. The theory was “rooted in a real event—a 1927 decision to dynamite levees outside of New Orleans, the logic there being that they were going to flood low-lying areas and save the city itself,” Merlan said in an interview with Mother Jones’ Becca Andrews. “[I]t created a lingering sense of suspicion that maybe the government would do this again.”View points out that the concern about elites preying on children isn’t baseless, either. “The core of elements of the systematic elite child abuse theories—they aren’t crazy,” he says. “There are instances of wealthy powerful abusing children and other people covering it up. Jeffrey Epstein, the Catholic Church. People have the sense that elites can commit horrifying crimes and get away with them.” The Epstein arrest earlier this month has done much to ratify the QAnon worldview. “This is just the beginning,” declared QAnoner Liz Crokin, a former gossip journalist. “The Storm is officially here.”And thus does the legitimate concern about elite predation and impunity get woven into a demeaning and dangerous social crusade. The “Storm” cited by Crokin—also known as “The Great Awakening”—is part of the vivid eschatology that QAnon adherents share with tradi­tional conservative culture warriors, one in which judgment is at last be rendered against liberals, and the nuclear family is restored to its proper place. “One thing they often talk about after ‘The Storm’ is that they imagine that the economy will be restored so that a single income can support a family again,” View says. “They imagine traditional gender roles and norms will be upheld and how children are raised will return to what [it] used to be.”Down the rabbit hole: Private investigator Ted Gunderson shows a hole dug by parents searching for an alleged secret sex room at the McMartin preschool in Manhattan Beach, California.Larry Davis/Los Angeles Times/GettyThe differences between the pedophile conspiracies of the 1980s and those of today are telling in their own way. There’s the matter of scale. The pedophile witch hunt of the ’80s managed to mobilize entire institutions, with much of the media uncritically amplifying its falsehoods and police taking action based on shoddy nonevidence. Lives were ruined around the country. But except for some reckless far-right pundits and websites, the media hasn’t taken the claims of Pizzagate and QAnon seriously. Earnest conversations about the conspiracies are limited to online image boards and social media.There’s also the nature of the targets. Where the pedophile conspiracies of the 1980s attacked the institutional emblems of feminist progress, the pedophile conspir­acies of the 2010s attack the cultural emblems of creeping cosmopolitanism. The ritual abuse of the 1980s supposedly happened in the suburbs in state or state-licensed institutions such as schools and child-care facilities. Today the abuse happens in businesses in cosmopolitan cities. Comet Ping Pong, in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of DC, is known as a welcoming space that regularly showcases progressive DIY artists and musicians—“a tangible emblem,” in the words of University of New Haven sociology professor Jeffrey S. Debies-­Carl, “of inclusivity, tolerance, and other progressive values that are threatening to the conspiracy-­prone alt-Right.”British historian Norman Cohn, in his book Europe’s Inner Demons, finds elements of pedophile conspiracies throughout history. In the 1st century B.C., members of the Catiline conspiracy, an aristocratic plot to overthrow the Roman Republic, supposedly swore an oath over the entrails of a boy and then ate them. And in the witch hunts of the 15th–17th centuries, tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed over allegations that they’d performed ritual child murder, among other heinous acts.The conspiracy theories documented by Cohn are fundamentally political. The rituals they describe are the means “by which a group of conspirators affirms its solidarity,” he writes, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing “an existing ruler or regime and to seize power.” The mass witch hunts that followed are political too, based on the “demonological obsessions of the intelligentsia.” The history of American political reaction is full of sex demons. Jim Crow was buttressed by myths about black male virility. Likewise, North Carolina’s infamous bathroom bill was sold in part on the fear that predatory men could say they’re transgender to gain access to women’s bathrooms. Opponents of abortion rights continue to conjure gory fantasies of promiscuous women committing “infanticide,” an incitement that Trump turned into an applause line in an April rally.In this way, pedophile conspiracies act as a sort of propaganda of the counterrevolution, a fun-house reflection of the real threats to the social order. This is what connects QAnon and Pizzagate to McMartin to the witch hunts of the Middle Ages to the dawn of major religions. The demons may take different forms, but the conspiracy is basically the same: Our house is under attack.“Decay of morals grows from day to day,” goes one despairing account. A secret cabal is wreaking havoc across the land, the man complains to his friend. Its members “recognize one another by secret signs and marks,” and “everywhere they introduce a kind of religion of lust” that subverts “ordinary fornication.” There is a rumor that they worship the “private parts of their director and high priest.” Maybe the rumor is false, “but such suspicions naturally attach to their secret and nocturnal rites.”In this dialogue, written by Marcus Minucius Felix in the 2nd century, the Roman pagan Caecilius Natalis speaks of Christians the way Pizzagaters described John Podesta and his fellow liberal elite. Natalis is particularly incensed by the cult’s initiation ritual. The details are as “revolting as they are notorious”: New members are initiated into the cult, he reports, by stabbing and killing an infant who has been coated in dough.Subscribe to our free newsletters.We recently wrapped up the crowdfunding campaign for our ambitious Mother Jones Corruption Project, and it was a smashing success.

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar was engulfed in a crowd of cheering supporters Thursday at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, a loud counterpoint to a turbulent week in Congress where she came under a sustained rhetorical assault from President Donald Trump and his supporters.More than 100 people filled the baggage claim area with songs, signs and cheers of “Welcome home, Ilhan,” providing a stark contrast to chants of “Send her back!” that reverberated through a Trump rally in North Carolina just a day before. In brief remarks, a defiant Omar vowed to “continue to be a nightmare to this president, because his policies are a nightmare to us.”“We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready. We are in the ring,” Omar said before departing for a town hall in south Minneapolis. “We are in the people’s house, and we are going to continue to fight it until we have the America we know we all deserve.”The enthusiastic welcome capped a contentious week for the Minneapolis Democrat as the president repeatedly used his bully pulpit — and his Twitter megaphone — to single out Omar and three other progressive women of color serving in the U.S. House.The situation intensified Wednesday when Trump once again lashed out at “the Squad” during a rally in North Carolina, falsely claiming that Omar, a refugee from Somalia, said she loves the terrorist group al-Qaida. Shouts of “Traitor!” and “Send her back!” rose from the crowd.On Thursday, the president distanced himself from the chants, which echoed words he had tweeted himself just days before.“I was not happy with it,” he told reporters at the White House, maintaining — despite video evidence to the contrary — that he tried to stop the outburst. “I disagree with it.”But the president reiterated his criticism of Omar and her colleagues, saying they “have a big obligation — and the obligation is to love your country.”The Twitter hashtag #IStandWithIlhan trended nationwide Thursday morning, as supporters, presidential candidates and even the rapper Cardi B flocked to her defense. Prominent Republicans, many of whom remained silent in the wake of Trump’s original tweet suggesting Omar and the other three members “go back” to their countries — even though all four are U.S. citizens and three were born here — condemned the chants.“There’s no place for that kind of talk. I don’t agree with that,” Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, said at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. But like many other Republicans, Emmer stopped short of criticizing the president or his original remarks. He said that while Trump was wrong in his phrasing, “there’s not a racist bone in this president’s body.”A spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn issued a statement criticizing policy proposals backed by liberal Democrats and said the Minnesota Republican does not believe the president is a racist. Rep. Pete Stauber, a fellow freshman Minnesota Republican, did not respond to a request for comment.The president’s attacks have prompted renewed concerns about the safety of the congresswoman and other members on the receiving end of Trump’s attacks. Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, has already received death threats, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to request a security assessment and increased protection from U.S. Capitol Police.“It’s crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger,” Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., told Politico. “He has threatened the safety of a member of Congress. That takes this to a whole different level.”Many Omar supporters at the airport rally Thursday echoed those fears.“I fear for her, I’m afraid for her. I’m afraid something could happen to her,” Linda Garrett-Johnson said.Garrett-Johnson, who lives in Apple Valley, said she traveled to the airport to show Omar that “Minnesota is standing with her.” She said she was appalled by Trump’s comments.“I heard things like that growing up a person of color,” said Garrett-Johnson, who is black. “I didn’t ever think that I would ever live to hear it from the president of the United States.”Political attacks against the congresswoman will likely intensify as the 2020 election nears and Trump seeks to tie Democrats nationwide to Omar and other members of the party’s most liberal wing. While her progressive politics and groundbreaking election to Congress rendered her political celebrity on the left, a series of controversial remarks about Israel and its U.S. backers opened her to bipartisan criticism. National GOP groups have already made Omar’s positions, including controversial comments that were criticized as using anti-Semitic tropes, the subject of e-mail blasts and TV ads.On Thursday, at least two local organizations reported receiving inflammatory mailers accusing Omar of having a “plan to destroy America.” The mailers arrived in envelopes labeled “Urgent” and “Past Due” and marked as if they had been sent by Xcel Energy, though they were postmarked from Phoenix. In a tweet, Xcel condemned the mail piece and said the company has contacted authorities about the apparent mail fraud.“It’s clearly a smear, and in the wake of the president’s tweets and the chant last night, if feels extremely Islamophobic and racist,” said Isaiah Breen, spokesman for Jewish Community Action, which received one of the mailers.Torey Van Oot reports on Minnesota politics and government for the Star Tribune.Jessie Van Berkel writes about Minnesota government and politics at the Star Tribune.

Lori Garver is chief executive at Earthrise Alliance and was deputy NASA administrator from 2009 to 2013. NASA was not created to do something again. It was created to push the limits of human understanding — to help the nation solve big, impossible problems that require advances in science and technology. Fifty years ago, the impossible problem was putting a human on the moon to win the space race, and all of humanity has benefited from the accomplishment.The impossible problem today is not the moon. And it’s not Mars. It’s our home planet, and NASA can once again be of service for the betterment of all.Let’s remember our history. We went to the moon 50 years ago in response to the Soviet Union’s perceived domination of spaceflight. The 12 Americans who walked on the moon brought back 842 pounds of lunar material (rocks and dust), learned about our closest planetary body’s geology and gave us a view of the Earth that changed our perspective. But that’s not what drove NASA spending to 4 percent of the federal budget in 1965. We were willing to stake so much on the moon landing — only because there was so much at stake.After accomplishing this amazing feat, the aerospace community has again and again sought presidential proclamations to go further. President Trump is the fifth president to proclaim we will send humans to the moon and/or Mars within a specific time frame, a decree without a value proposition that has never inspired broad public support nor come close to coming true.NASA remains one the most revered and valuable brands in the world, and the agency is at its best when given a purpose. But the public doesn’t understand the purpose of spending massive amounts of money to send a few astronauts to the moon or Mars. Are we in another race, and if so, is this the most valuable display of our scientific and technological leadership? If science is the rationale, we can send robots for pennies on the dollar. In a July Pew Research Center study, 63 percent of respondents said monitoring key parts of Earth’s climate system should be the highest priority for the United States’ space agency — sending astronauts to the moon was their lowest priority, at 13 percent ; 18 percent favor Mars.The public is right about this. Climate change — not Russia, much less China — is today’s existential threat. Data from NASA satellites show that future generations here on Earth will suffer from food and water shortages, increased disease and conflict over diminished resources. In 2018, the National Academy of Sciences released its decadal survey for Earth science and declared that NASA should prioritize the study of the global hydrological cycle; distribution and movement of mass between oceans, ice sheets, ground water and atmosphere; and changes in surface biology and geology. Immediately developing these sensors and satellites while extending existing missions would increase the cadence of new, more precise measurements and contribute to critical, higher-fidelity climate models.NASA could also move beyond measurement and into action — focusing on solutions for communities at the front lines of drought, flooding and heat extremes. It could develop and disseminate standardized applications that provide actionable information to populations that are the most vulnerable. NASA could create a Climate Corps — modeled after the Peace Corps — in which scientists and engineers spend two years in local communities understanding the unique challenges they face, training local populations and connecting them with the data and science needed to support smart, local decision-making.The fragmented system of roles and responsibilities related to handing the massive amounts of Earth science data is severely hampering global efforts required to make significant progress. The U.S. government role in addressing this challenge is foundering without leadership. Standardizing data collection and coordinating its storage, analysis and distribution require experience working across disciplines, government agencies and universities as well as the private sector and international community. Only NASA has done this sort of thing before; only NASA has the credibility and expertise to do it again.Assigning NASA this task would require an Apollo-scale change — but could be accomplished within its existing mandate and by shifting funding priorities. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 supports expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and phenomena in the atmosphere and directs the agency to develop and carry out a comprehensive program of research, technology and monitoring to understand and maintain the integrity of the Earth’s atmosphere. The act requires NASA to work with other federal agencies, academia and the private sector to make the necessary observations, disseminate their results and enlist the support and cooperation of appropriate scientists and engineers of other countries and international organizations.Apollo’s legacy should not be more meaningless new goals and arbitrary deadlines. Let’s not repeat the past. Let’s try to save our future. Besides, humanity’s intrinsic need to explore is driven by our need to survive.Read more: George F.

The internet has its perils with privacy breaches and fake news, but on the plus side, a whole generation of youth have been teaching themselves skills in leadership and community-building, according to a new University of California, Davis, study.These self-governing internet communities, in the form of games, social networks or informational websites such as Wikipedia, create their own rule systems that help groups of anonymous users work together. They build hierarchies, create punishments, and write and enforce home-grown policies. Along the way, participants learn to avoid autocrats and find the leaders that govern well.“As scientists learn these lessons vicariously, at scale, self-governance online promises not only to breed more savvy defenders of democracy, but inform the design and growth of healthy, informed, participatory cultures in the real world,” said Seth Frey, UC Davis assistant professor of communication and the lead author of a new study published July 11 in PLOS ONE.For five years, researchers looked at the multiplayer “virtual world” video game Minecraft, one of a few games with a decentralized, amateur-driven hosting model and a large user base. The game involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. It is known for its open, un-plotted structure, according to the study. In Minecraft, players can build structures, creations and artwork on multiplayer servers and single player worlds across multiple game modes. Research suggests that 80% to 90% of players are males, with a median age of 19.To conduct the study, researchers designed a program to collect publicly available data from managers of Minecraft communities all over the world. They scanned the internet every two hours for two years, visiting communities to learn how they are run, who visits them and how regularly those visitors return. They observed 150,000 communities, then focused on a subset of 1,800 that they identified as successful.Minecraft is self-hosted on a public web server. Web servers, like other computers, have limits in processing power, bandwidth and electricity. So, failing to provide any of these services adequately can damage a community, Frey explained.“Minecraft is especially resource-intensive, making these challenges especially critical.” These challenges are difficult enough that most communities, 19 out of 20, fail, he said.Unlike websites visited by most people, many successful Minecraft servers are not run by professionals in governance or policy design. Instead, amateurs — players who want control over their own community — take on the challenge of selecting a system of governance that attracts and supports peers with a common vision, he said. Over time, administrators can install bits of software that implement dimensions of governance, including private property rights, peer monitoring, social hierarchy, trade and many others.“Picking from an a la carte menu of rule types, players assemble highly variable and individualistic forms of government,” Frey said. “Although there are trends in what makes an effective government, especially among the largest communities, one of the major surprises of the study is the diversity of systems that prove viable.”Given the difficulty of building a successful online community, especially in an anonymous youth-driven game such as Minecraft, it is likely that the leadership skills that successful players develop could translate to real-world domains. Proving this transfer of governance ability to real-world environments is a goal of future research, Frey said.“This analysis of large internet communities shows that in addition to making it easier for giant malevolent agents to undermine democracy, it also brings successful community-building closer, which gives a lot more people experience with leadership and governance and feelings of responsibility to a community,” he added.The study was co-authored by Robert W. Sumner of ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

Democratic lawmakers hope to use special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s public testimony Wednesday to revisit dramatic episodes in which President Trump attempted to derail or interfere with the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.In his final report, Mueller declined to come to any conclusion as to whether Trump obstructed justice and therefore committed a crime.But his prosecutors unspooled vivid details about an anxious and angry president willing to break long-standing traditions of presidential behavior to try to control the course of what was supposed to be an independent criminal investigation.Some Democratic lawmakers contend that a public airing of the president’s behavior at the coming hearing will move public and congressional opinion and may help build a case that Trump’s actions warrant impeachment — even if Mueller did not recommend criminal prosecution.“For many Americans this will be blockbuster, new information,” predicted Rep. Ted W. Lieu, a California Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who said he plans to quiz Mueller about the instances of possible obstruction of justice described in the report.“We just need him to convey the facts, and that will result in people learning . . . there is a lot of evidence that the president obstructed justice,” Lieu said.Republicans assert there is no need to rehash material Mueller described over hundreds of pages in a report that has been available to the public since April. They note Mueller came to no conclusion that the president broke the law.The ranking Republican on the panel, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), predicted during a Fox News interview last week that the hearing is going to demonstrate “nothing is there” in terms of Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia.It will reinforce what the report said, Collins told Fox, adding he hoped the hearing might also reveal more about “the corrupt cabal” — a reference to the FBI officials involved in the investigation who had expressed strong feelings against the president.Mueller’s report painted a portrait of a president who repeatedly sought to get aides and associates to disrupt the special counsel’s investigation and whose efforts were periodically stymied only because underlings refused to follow his instructions.When informed of Mueller’s appointment in May 2017, Mueller’s report indicates Trump slumped in his chair and declared, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency.”Trump then quickly lashed out.At one point, he ordered his White House counsel to direct that Mueller be fired over conflicts of interest his own staff had told him were “ridiculous.” Later, after news reports revealed how close White House counsel Donald McGahn had come to resigning rather than be involved with Mueller’s firing, Trump tried to pressure McGahn to announce the accurate stories were in fact false and file an inaccurate memo for White House files denying the report.Trump also directed his former campaign manager — a private citizen — to order the attorney general to limit the scope of Mueller’s investigation only to future elections — not to Trump and his team’s actions. He lashed out at witnesses who were cooperating with the investigation, including his one-time personal attorney Michael Cohen, and publicly praised witnesses like Paul Manafort, who seemed to be withholding key testimony from the special counsel.Mueller may resist a dramatic retelling of those events. In a 10-minute-long news conference announcing the end of his investigation in May, he said he did not wish to testify publicly, saying his testimony is all contained in the 448-page document his team submitted in the spring.Still, Democrats hope he will agree to reaffirm details already outlined in the document. Lieu said a fair review of these examples and others in the report would lead a reasonable person “to an inescapable conclusion: Donald Trump committed a felony.”Mueller did not draw that conclusion. Instead, he wrote that his team decided to avoid a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” one way or the other.Mueller has so far offered only a brief description of how he came to that decision, which took many legal experts by surprise, and lawmakers will probably press him to offer more information about his thinking.[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinions and ‘principles of fairness’]In his report, Mueller wrote that he felt bound by Justice Department policy memos that prohibit the criminal indictment of a sitting president.He then went a step further, writing that if Trump could not be indicted — a step that would initiate a process that would allow the president to defend himself in court — then “fairness concerns” counseled against even an analysis that could result in a conclusion that Trump broke the law.Still, Mueller added, “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.”Former prosectors have expressed particular confusion because Mueller’s team offered a detailed analysis of 10 episodes that raised concerns of possible obstruction of justice and, in several, appeared to conclude evidence existed that the elements that comprise an obstruction violation were present.For instance, McGahn told prosecutors Trump called him twice at home over a weekend in June 2017 and directed him to get Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to fire Mueller. “Mueller has to go,” McGahn recounted Trump told him. “Call me back when you do it.”Rather than following the order, McGahn drove to the White House to pack up his things and informed three other White House staffers he intended to resign. Ultimately, McGahn remained in his post, and Trump let the matter drop.Mueller wrote that “substantial evidence” existed that Trump’s efforts to remove Mueller were linked to the special counsel’s investigation of Trump’s conduct.He likewise wrote there was “substantial evidence” that Trump’s intent was to shield himself from inquiry when, two days later, he had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office with his loyal former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. In that meeting, Lewandowski told prosecutors Trump directed him to pass a message to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Trump wanted Lewandowski to get Sessions to limit Mueller’s investigation and declare Trump’s activities off limits. Discomfited by the request, Lewandowski ultimately asked a colleague, then-White House adviser Rick Dearborn, to pass the message instead. Dearborn also declined to follow through.[Stymied by aides, Trump sought out loyalist to curtail special counsel — and drew Mueller’s glare]More than 1,000 former federal prosecutors from Republican and Democratic administrations have signed a statement first circulated in May saying Mueller’s findings would have produced obstruction charges against Trump, were he not a sitting president.But the United States Attorneys’ Manual requires that prosecutors do more than determine whether there is evidence that the elements of a particular crime are present before they decide to file charges.They must also decide if prosecution would serve a “substantial federal interest” and whether there exists an “adequate noncriminal alternative to prosecution.” There is no evidence in the report that Mueller’s team performed an analysis of those additional questions.“Mueller was a failure as a special counsel the minute he decided that he would not fulfill his most basic task,” said Jonathan Turley, who teaches constitutional law at George Washington University.He called Mueller’s legal interpretation “incomprehensible” and likewise called him to task for not informing the public or his superiors at the Justice Department that he intended to duck a decision as to whether the president committed a crime.A former Watergate prosecutor, Richard Ben-Veniste, said Mueller has a public service obligation at the hearing to explain the significance of his findings.“He can do more to explain the danger of foreign meddling in our election process and the obstructive behavior of the president in the context of normal prosecutorial tradecraft,” Ben-Veniste said. The former prosecutor recommended Mueller look back at the news conference conducted by Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox just before he was fired in the so-called Saturday Night Massacre.Cox’s eloquent review of complex legal questions circulating in Washington in October 1973 gave the public the opportunity to see his reasons for rejecting a White House proposal to allow President Nixon to avoid turning over tapes as ordered by the courts. Providing public explanations of such knotty constitutional decisions, Ben-Veniste said, is part of the job of a special counsel.“What report on its own has ever galvanized the public into action?” Ben-Veniste asked.


During a meeting last week, a US Citizenship and Immigration Services official floated a radical cap for the number of refugees to be accepted into the country next year: zero.According to a Politico report, DHS representatives at the meeting countered with a cap in the 3,000 to 10,000 range.The Trump administration already slashed the cap by a third to 30,000 this year while also attempting to choke off asylum opportunities for migrants fleeing violence or devastating poverty.The meeting, though still preliminary, displays the reach of White House adviser Stephen Miller’s influence — the hardliner has maintained significant sway in President Donald Trump’s orbit.


JTA — A Muslim man who killed his Jewish neighbor in Paris while shouting about Allah is probably not criminally responsible for his actions because he had smoked marijuana beforehand, a French judge ruled.
The preliminary ruling in the trial of Kobili Traore for the 2017 murder of Sarah Halimi came Friday from a judge of inquiry — a magistrate that in the French justice system is tasked with deciding whether indicted defendants should in fact stand trial.
		Francis Khalifat, the president of the CRIF umbrella group of French Jewish communities, called the ruling “unsurprising but hardly justifiable.” He said his group and others will appeal in hopes of bringing Traore to trial.

							He could be hospitalized for treatment of his psychotic lapses or made to attend a drug rehabilitation program, or he could be released.Khalifat’s op-ed published Monday on the CRIF website follows a series of protests over perceived delays in Traore’s trial and the efforts, including by judges, that CRIF and others have condemned as attempts to prevent a murder trial.Sammy Ghozlan, a former police commissioner and founder of France’s Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in May that the handling of the Halimi case has made him “no longer have full confidence that anti-Semitic hate crimes in France are handled properly.”Traore pummeled Halimi, a physician and kindergarten teacher, for an hour as police stood outside the woman’s door, according to reports. He shouted about Allah and called her a “demon” before throwing her to her death. Traore had called Halimi’s daughter “dirty Jewess” two years before killing the mother, the daughter has said.

The earthquake was registered at 5.1 magnitude with an epicentre about 22km (14 miles) north-west of Athens. Athenians ran out into the streets and evacuated tall buildings as the tremor shook the capital for some 15 seconds.There were no reports of serious injuries but several aftershocks have been felt.The strongest shock was of 4.3 magnitude, almost an hour after the initial quake hit at 14:13 (11:13 GMT).The earthquake was particularly felt in the centre of Athens. There were reports that the fire service rescued over a dozen people trapped in elevators, following the power outage. Residents posted footage on social media of the impact of the quake.Έδωσε πόνο! #Seismos #σεισμος #earthquakes pic.twitter.com/nGKZfYOV2iEnd of Twitter post  by @lokahiouA woman was slightly hurt by falling plaster and an empty building collapsed, according to Greek reports. Other buildings were also damaged.The head of the anti-quake protection agency, Efthymios Lekkas, told Greeks to remain calm. "There is no reason for concern. The capital's buildings are built to withstand a much stronger earthquake," he said. Seismologists say the earthquake was around 13km (8 miles) from the surface, and its proximity was the reason why it was felt strongly. The earthquake is the first to hit the Greek capital since September 1999 and experts say it was very close to the same epicentre, at Mt Parnitha. That magnitude 6 quake left 143 people dead and tens of thousands of buildings damaged.Are you in the affected region?

Neuralink, a company bankrolled by billionaire Elon Musk, this week unveiled a new design for a brain-computer interface that it had tested in animals. Nathan Copeland is one of the few human beings who already has a working interface. He broke his spine in a car accident and is paralyzed from the chest down.In contrast to Neuralink's prototype, which connects to the brain through dozens of thin wires and is meant to eventually be small enough to sit inside the skull and transmit wirelessly, Copeland’s consists of four spiky silicon electrode pads in his brain (called Utah arrays), connected to the outside world through sockets atop his head. They let him control robots and computers, and they have sensations sent back into his brain.Since 2014 Copeland has been part of a research project at the University of Pittsburgh led by researchers Michael Boninger and Andrew Schwartz. We interviewed him about Neuralink’s news.Well, it’s pretty cool. It seemed like maybe it will work the way they want down the road, but it probably doesn’t work that way now. A couple of years ago, when I heard he was working with a neural interface, I said I would be there in a heartbeat. I was joking, but it’s interesting to think about what I am going to do when I get explanted. I am coming up on my five years. Then the FDA says my implants may have to come out. Neuralink talked about longevity of the implant and also a large number of electrodes. I always say I wish they had put more electrodes into me.Basically, the more electrodes you have, the more neurons you record from, so I would imagine higher-degree tasks would be easier. I am limited to thinking about my right arm and hand. I thought it would be good to have more control. I always want to play more video games.I was going to school at Penn State, Fayette, for nanofabrication, so I didn’t have a job, I was in school.Ha ha. Yes, and I wish the government did, too. But that is a whole rant about disability and stuff. I spend 12 hours a week at the lab doing testing, and I drive an hour each way. I have a monthly compensation, plus mileage and tolls. Ooh. Research participant? “BCI [brain-computer interface] pioneer” is what Blackrock calls us. Blackrock is the company that makes the Utah arrays, which I have four of.Ooh. Very cool. When you have an accident like mine, and you are limited to what you can do, and limited in what you can interact with in your environment, doing something like this is very cool and very rewarding, even if there are no health benefits.I like playing video games. So far, I play Sonic Hedgehog 2 mostly. I really want to play Final Fantasy 14, and I have played Pac-Man. Usually I just let them do the regular beneficial science stuff, though.I would play games with it. Honestly, that is what I would do. I used to love playing video games and I can’t at the same level anymore.I have two implants in the somatosensory cortex. The sensations really depend—they range from pressure, tingling, warmth, vibration, sometimes tapping. The sensations are at the base of my fingers, near my palms, or the knuckle.Yes and no. Some of them, like pressure and tapping, are pretty close to the natural real-world analogue. The tingles are not unnatural, but they have less obvious comparisons to sensations I would have felt before my accident. But now it’s second nature; they are natural to me at this point.In the broadest sense, yes, but that is mostly because I like saying nerdy things. I have a YouTube playlist called My Cyborg Adventure. [Editor’s note: here’s a video from Copeland’s playlist of him using a robotic arm to eat a taco.]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjfA78FuZMSince I do have the sensory implants, there are five or six people designing tasks and collecting data. I will also do tasks that only use the robot. Right now, I am doing one task reaching for an object. Then there are sensory-only tasks—they will stimulate every electrode one at a time at 60 microamps, and I will tell them what it feels like. Then there are a whole lot of virtual tasks, where I will grab things and use different force levels, so it can decode more accurately how hard I am trying to grab.It’s a KUKA LBR assembly robot. It’s my favorite robot so far. It’s basically the kind of robot that builds cars. First I used the APL Arm, then the Luke arm from DEKA, and those have a limitation because they are meant to be anatomical—they can only reach how an arm can. That is not a limit that I should have. The Kuka has a lot of articulation. If I think up, it can move up and keep the arm parallel to the ground. It’s a lot faster. I like it.I can pick up a tennis ball for sure. It has a gripper. I pick up and move things across a table as many times as I can in two minutes. I broke my own record. I have pretty awesome control of it.Not yet, but they are getting approvals for me to use it at home with a tablet. It’s a medical tablet, so it’s not as powerful as I would like it to be. It’s not the latest stuff—it doesn’t have a lot of processing power. But it would be fun to play around with it on my own on my free days.That is a hard one to really answer. It’s a yes and no. I would have to have a pretty in-depth discussion with him or his team to see what is going on. I know that it is easy to show something off as fancier than it is, or more ready for prime time than it is. When I signed up, I was the first human to have implants in the sensory cortex, but I was not the first to have the Utah array; it had been tested before. There are about 20 of us so far, I think.Me? To help push the technology so it is commonplace enough to really help people out, so they don’t go through the things that I went through. The depression and the feeling that you can’t do anything anymore and can’t contribute to society—it’s just despair.Joining this study has given me a sense of purpose. Someone needs to do it, and I am not really doing much else. I hope it gets to the point where if you have an injury and insurance will pay for it, you can get back functions, maybe functions that you could never have had before.I am assuming there is going to be considerably more risk with Neuralink. If you are comparison shopping for brain implants, I think the Utah array is less risky. I do have pedestals on top of my head, and I have to worry about keeping it clean, and the skin receding. A wireless one would be less risky in that way. But the way their [Neuralink’s] electrodes go in, they are hair-width, and there are a lot of them. If something went wrong, and you needed to get it explanted, that could be really tricky.I always think the stuff he is doing is pretty cool. Well, really cool. I would like to go to space, and I would like to have a Tesla wheelchair van.Honestly, I would have wanted one before my injury. I understand why they can’t just start at that point, but I think that it would be a cool place to end up in the future. Right now, I think paralyzed people are basically the test pilots. The FDA doesn’t want to see stuff put in someone’s head who is able bodied, because jamming electrodes in your motor cortex, you could lose function. So starting with people who lost function already is the jumping-off point. It’s a technology that could be a huge help, for a broad degree of different conditions, and could allow for new things.I thought it was really cool, and for a moment there I was maybe kind of jealous of the person that ends up with one of these things, assuming it works, and gets to do all the cool stuff and be the new rock star of the BCI world. If it all ends up working out, it’s going to definitely change the world and how we think about these things.Antonio Regalado

Queen Elizabeth II.
  We’ve all dreamed of what it would be like to live in Buckingham  Palace – and you might just be in with a chance if you know your  way around a kitchen. The  Queen is hiring a Demi Chef de Partie to work and live in the  palace full-time.  Her Majesty is looking for someone “ambitious” and “with a  passion for food” to join her staff at the royal household.  The starting salary is £22,076 ($27,623) per annum – which is  around the average salary of Demi Chef de Parties in London,  according to   Adzuna.Read More:   Rare footage shows how the Queen’s butlers navigate Buckingham  Palace’s winding corridors   Although you won’t be getting a salary fit for a king, the job  includes free live-in accommodation with meals provided, and a  15% employer contribution pension scheme.  The advertisement stipulates that the role would involve  traveling to other royal residences as well.   It reads: “As you’d expect, standards are exceptionally  high here, and every day is busy, so you’ll need to be an  ambitious and qualified chef. You may have some  previous experience within a premier kitchen or volume catering  environment, but it’s your ability and enthusiasm to deliver  across all sections of the kitchen that we’re looking for.  “This role will be based in London, and will involve  traveling to other Royal residences. In return, you can look  forward to working in a unique and stimulating work environment.”    If you end up applying for the job, be warned – you won’t  be able to tell anyone if you get it.Read more:   Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly hiring a dog walker  to take their dogs for strolls in the grounds of Windsor  Castle  As tempting as it would be to flood your Instagram account  with photos from inside the royal household, you actually    won’t be allowed to tell people that you work at the palace.    Back in April,   INSIDER spoke to Philippa Smith, managing director of Silver  Swan Recruitment Agency – the company that decides who gets to  work for the royals.  “Neither us nor the candidates can disclose who they are  working for to third parties,” she said.  “There is also a ban on social media – as in nothing  whatsoever about their role, the family, the location or any  other details can be posted online.”  The closing date is Sunday, July 28. To apply for the role,  visit the   Royal Household’s official website.

Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLondon's Crossrail project will probably go even further over budget, according to a report by MPs.Commuters have been "let down" by a programme that is well behind schedule, the Public Accounts Committee said.MPs said they were "sceptical" about the Department for Transport's "ability to oversee major rail projects".In response, the Department for Transport said it had acted "swiftly and effectively" when problems at Crossrail became clear.Construction on the Crossrail route began in 2009. It is Europe's biggest infrastructure project.It has been officially named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen. When completed, it will serve 41 stations, connecting Reading, to the west of London, with Shenfield, to the east. The line will make use of some existing track, but involves 26 miles of new tunnels connecting Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to improve rail capacity crossing the capital.The project was allocated £14.8bn in 2010, but this has since swollen to £17.6bn.While it was originally expected to start running services throughout the line in December, Crossrail now expects it to open as late as March 2021.The Public Accounts Committee also criticised the bonuses paid to bosses, even as the project faltered. The chief executive at the time, Andrew Wolstenholme, was paid a bonus of £481,000 for the year to 2016 and £160,000 for the year to 2017. The Department for Transport allowed itself few powers to curb bosses' pay following their failings, it said."While the department is now working to learn and apply the lessons from what went wrong with Crossrail, it should acknowledge that this is far from an unfamiliar tale," the committee said."We have witnessed cost increases and delays on major rail projects several times over the past few years and the department still does not appear to have got a grip on the problem."A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: "The department consistently challenged the leadership of Crossrail Ltd - a wholly owned subsidiary of TfL [Transport for London] - on the delivery of the project."When problems became clear, the department acted swiftly and effectively, changing the leadership of the board and strengthening governance structures."The new Crossrail Ltd management team has now produced a new plan to open the railway, and the department and TfL will continue to scrutinise progress to ensure this happens as soon as possible."£14.8bnexpected cost in 2010£17.6bnexpected cost as of 2019December 2018Original scheduled launchMarch 2021Current expected completion, without Bond Street15,000people have worked on Crossrail60 milesDistance of the line from Reading to HeathrowCrossrail split the work between 36 contractors, creating a large burden of organisational work, the report said. A spokesperson for Crossrail said: "The Elizabeth Line is one of the most complex infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK and we recognise many of the challenges raised in the Public Accounts Committee report. "The new leadership team's plan to complete the Elizabeth Line continues to be kept under careful review. Progress against our plan will become clearer in 2020, once we start to fully test the operational railway and integrate the train and signalling software. "We are fully focused on completing the Elizabeth Line and ensuring a safe and reliable passenger service as quickly as possible."An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two.Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes.In May, Crossrail was criticised by the National Audit Office for running late and over budget, suggesting that bosses had clung to an unrealistic opening date.The supreme court says peacekeeping soldiers from the Netherlands are partly to blame for 350 killings.15 sayings from around the world


3 Min ReadTHE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch government accepted on Friday that the state was partially liable for the deaths in 1995 of 350 Muslim males who were expelled from a U.N. base and killed by Bosnian Serb forces at Srebrenica. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld a previous ruling against the Dutch state and set its liability at 10% of the overall loss suffered. “The government accepts the verdict of the Supreme Court,” the defense ministry said in a statement. “The state thereby accepts liability for the damages as determined by the Supreme Court.” The Dutch ruling paves the way for payments to the families of victims and survivors of the killings at Srebrenica, when around 8,000 Muslim men and boys in all were taken away and murdered in what was the worst mass slaughter on European soil since World War Two. It was recognised as a genocide by the International Court of Justice. The adjudication of 10% liability means claimants are only likely to receive around a few thousand euros in compensation. However, the case could still set an international legal precedent for states’ liability when they contribute troops to peacekeeping operations.  During the Bosnian conflict in 1995, several hundred outgunned Dutch peacekeeping troops had been assigned to protect a U.N.-designated “safe area” where thousands of Muslims had sought refuge from Bosnian Serb forces - among them 350 men who made it into the Dutch base. The Supreme Court found that the Dutch forces could have allowed those men to stay in the base and that, by handing them over, they had knowingly and unlawfully sent them to possible abuse or death at the hands of the Bosnian Serb troops. “They took away the men’s chance to stay out of the hands of the Bosnian Serbs,” it said. Kada Hotic, one of the Mothers of Srebrenica group of survivors present in court, told Reuters that the Dutch government was responsible for the start of the genocide in Srebrenica.  “No matter if it’s one percent, ten percent or 100 percent, they are responsible,” she said. A lawyer for the victims said he would study the verdict to see if there are possibilities to fight the case further at the European Court of Human Rights. While the supreme court upheld the partial liability of the state, it rejected a second charge - that the assistance given by Dutch forces in removing those gathered outside the base had been unlawful. “Their accountability can never be erased. We won’t leave it here, we will go to the European court to see if we have the right to justice as Muslims,” said Munira Subasic, another plaintiff in the case.   The amount of the damages was not specified by the Supreme Court on Friday, but in an earlier case the Dutch state paid tens of thousands of euros to several survivors.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah boy has earned widespread social media attention for his neighborhood soda stand thanks to a sign he holds that reads, “Ice Cold Beer” with “root” above the word beer in tiny print.Several residents in the northern Utah city called police earlier this week concerned about a young boy selling alcohol in front of a church, said Brigham City Police Lt. Tony Ferderber on Thursday.Officers that went to check it out realized that it was just a clever marketing ploy and posted pictures of 11-year-old Seth Parker on Facebook with the comment, “a twist on a lemonade stand.”Sen. Mitt Romney, of Utah, tweeted a picture of Seth with the comment, “A lesson in reading the fine print! The future is bright for this young Utah entrepreneur.”Seth’s mother Alexis Parker said Thursday that the family is dumbfounded and excited by all the attention. She estimated that some 60 people a day come to the stand.Seth started the stand because his parents urged him to get out more after they noticed he had struggled to make new friends since the family moved from Georgia last year, Alexis Parker said.Seth thought about a yard sale or lemonade stand but settled on selling the soda because he is a root beer “fanatic,” she said. He chose the sign with the tiny print as a little “wise crack.”The first day brought some scoffs and scowls, especially for people without good vision, she said.But people soon caught on to the joke.“We’re loving people stopping by and just having a good laugh,” said Alexis Parker. “It is a joy all the way around.”

The NOAA report was released as the US prepares for a "dangerous heatwave". The National Weather Service has warned that tens of millions of people will be affected by excessive heat in the coming days, with temperatures expected to reach up to 110F (43.3C).

    Des Moines, Iowa -- A Guatemalan man who apparently entered the U.S. illegally after being deported twice has been charged with killing an Iowa woman and her two children. Marvin Oswaldo Escobar-Orellana, 31, made an initial court appearance Thursday in Des Moines, where the judge set his bond at $3 million cash and scheduled his next hearing for July 29. He is charged with three counts of first-degree murder and hasn't entered a plea.Escobar-Orellana was arrested Tuesday night in the fatal shootings of 29-year-old Rossibeth Flores-Rodriguez and her two children, 11-year-old Grecia Daniela Alvarado-Flores and 5-year-old Ever Jose Mejia-Flores.A police spokesman said investigators have been told that Flores-Rodriguez had come to Iowa to work with Escobar-Orellana, a self-employed roofer. The bodies of the three were found at the home that they shared with Escobar-Orellana, police Sgt. Paul Parizek said Thursday. Escobar-Orellana's wife and his own children also lived in the home, but were not at the home at the time of the killings, Parizek said.Police have also been told that Flores-Rodriguez met the suspect in her home country of Honduras.Parizek said he has no information on the slain family's immigration status. A  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said Thursday that the agency doesn't release such information about victims of violent crimes.More in ImmigrationEscobar-Orellana called 911 after the shootings, authorities said. In a criminal complaint, police say that according to an unidentified witness, Escobar-Orellana shot Flores-Rodriguez during an argument and then went inside the family's condo and shot the children, the Des Moines Register reported.Escobar-Orellana gave investigators a different version of events. He said Flores-Rodriguez killed the children and that he shot her in self-defense, police say in the complaint.During his hearing, Escobar-Orellana asked the Polk County Associate Judge Becky Goettsch through a Spanish-language interpreter why he was charged with all three killings, when he only killed one person -- and that in self-defense. But police say that ballistic evidence supports the witness' account of what happened.Goettsch assigned the public defender's office to represent Escobar-Orellana, but the office hadn't assigned anyone to the case by midday Thursday, and court records didn't list an attorney for him.According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Escobar-Orellana gave police a false name when they arrested him: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.Escobar-Orellana was deported in 2010 and again in 2011, said ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer. In 2010, Escobar-Orellana was convicted of illegal entry into the U.S.His 2011 deportation stemmed from illegal entry to the U.S. near Laredo, Texas, court records said. He was sentenced to 15 days confinement and ordered not to return to the country illegally.ICE has filed an immigration detainer and administrative arrest warrant with the Polk County Jail, Neudauer said. An immigrant who re-enters the country without authorization after having been previously deported can be charged with a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.Amid a heated political debate over immigration across the country, at least two Republicans were quick to point at the arrest as evidence of weak border enforcement.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security seeking records of Escobar-Orellana's full immigration history.  "The ugly act of violence that claimed the lives of a mother and her two children in Des Moines this week is shocking and heartbreaking. What's worse, it appears that laws in place to protect against such violence failed this young family," Grassley said. "It is crucial we understand how someone who had been twice deported from this country was able to re-enter for at least a third time and commit such an act of senseless violence. This case demonstrates yet again the need for Congress to take action to more effectively secure our border and keep dangerous criminals from so easily entering the United States."Rep. Steve King, a staunchly conservative House member from Iowa who was sanctioned earlier this year by his congressional colleagues for defending white supremacy and white nationalism, also cited the case."There are thousands of graves across this countryside that are there because we didn't enforce immigration law," King told CBS affiliate KCCI TV on Thursday. "They would be alive today if we didn't have sanctuary policies and if we enforced immigration laws evenly and steadily across the board."The Des Moines Public Schools issued a statement following news of the deaths, saying Grecia had just completed fifth grade at Moulton Elementary School and Ever would have begun kindergarten there this fall.School officials' "hearts are heavy" over the deaths, the release said.

To some, she’s the “Forever First Lady” but across the world, Michelle Obama is the “most admired.”According to a recent YouGov.com poll, which surveyed 42,000 people in 41 countries, the former First Lady topped the list as the “Most Admired Woman in the World.”Mrs. O even beat out her pal, media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who came in second.Academy Award-winning actress and human rights activist Angelina Jolie landed in third place, while Queen Elizabeth II was fourth on the list.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — another former First Lady — clocked in at number 8 while pop diva Madonna ranked at number 11.Bringing pride to the LGTBQ community, Ellen DeGeneres was number 15.Current First Lady Melania Trump came in at number 19 out of 20.Meanwhile, on the Most Admired Men’s list Michelle’s husband, former President Barack Obama, came in at number two.Billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates topped the list, while international action star Jackie Chan kicked in at number three.On the YouGov survey of the Most Admired Men in the U.S., Obama bested Donald Trump, who came in at number two.Mrs. Obama was once again number one on the women’s list.


This viciousness isn’t an accident. It’s what Trumpism is really about.“Send her back! Send her back! Send her back!”It’s hard not to feel chills when you watch the video of a Trump rally in North Carolina where this chant, directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar, breaks out. The president, in the middle of a diatribe against Omar, pauses and looks out as the crowd chants — not smiling, exactly, but doing nothing to calm the chanters or quiet their refrain.That moment, the chant demanding that a naturalized citizen and member of Congress be “sent back” to her native Somalia booming through an audience of thousands, put on display the particular fusion of racism and authoritarianism that defines Trumpism as a political movement.“Send her back” is not the first such chant to break out at Trump events; it follows “lock her up,” the ritual demand from Trump supporters that Hillary Clinton be sent to jail. Together, “lock her up” and “send her back” demonstrate beyond doubt that the law, in the Trumpian view, is a vehicle for punishing political enemies and minority groups. In the Trumpian imagination, political opponents are not mere rivals but existential threats aligned with anti-American elements (read: immigrants and minorities) in a bid to undermine everything they cherish about America. As such, Clinton and Omar should not merely be defeated in an election; they must be crushed. If that requires abusing the power of the state and twisting the law to do so, so be it.This authoritarian impulse, cross-bred with bigotry, has helped birth some of the worst excesses of the Trump era — from the Muslim ban to family separation to the failed attempt to circumvent the courts and place a citizenship question on the census. Such behavior has been made possible and permitted by the Republican Party, whose leaders either are willing to tolerate Trump’s authoritarian white revanchism in exchange for tax cuts and Brett Kavanaugh or, worse, actively agree with it.Trump’s attack on Omar appears to be a preview of his broader 2020 strategy. There is every reason to expect things will get worse.Democracy depends — and democratic systems survive — on the fair and neutral application of the law: You can’t arrest people without good reason to believe they broke the law, and you especially can’t arrest them simply because you see them as a political rival. In theory, both major American parties are committed to this idea: It’s one of those “norms” you’re always hearing about, But since the rise of Trump, it’s become increasingly clear that Republicans and their voters are more than willing to call for bending the system’s powers to partisan, racialized ends.“Lock her up” is not merely an expression of the false belief that Hillary Clinton’s email scandal was criminal. “Send her back” is not the result of a baroque theory that Ilhan Omar is not legally an American citizen. Instead, the chants are meant to signal that Clinton and Omar are threats to the body politic who need to be purged if it is to be preserved.Trump, along with numerous Republicans and Fox News hosts, have made this an explicit feature of their rhetoric. At a June rally in Florida, just weeks before Trump’s racist attacks on Omar and the rest of “the Squad” began in earnest, he cast the Democratic Party as a threat to the very lives of his supporters. “They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it,” he thundered.When you believe this, there is no longer any need to adhere to the liberal theory of law as neutral protector of freedoms. In its place, you get the “send her back” theory of law: the notion that the purpose of holding legal power is to defeat your enemies, an anti-democratic theory that has been encouraged at Trump rallies for years.The chants originate with Trump himself. He openly mused about prosecuting Clinton during the 2016 campaign and has spent the past week telling Omar to go back to “her” country. The broader Republican apparatus, leading elected officials and their allies in the conservative media, did not condemn these chants or the presidential statements encouraging them. Quite the opposite: At the 2016 Republican National Convention, future Trump national security adviser (and current confessed criminal) Michael Flynn led the crowd in a “lock her up” litany.One thing we learned from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is that Trump’s desire to prosecute Clinton was not an idle threat. The report documents three separate occasions when Trump attempted to strong-arm then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions into launching a criminal investigation into Clinton. In March 2019, he openly hoped that current Attorney General William Barr would “do what’s fair” when it came to going after the woman he routinely called Crooked Hillary.A deeply authoritarian attitude has taken root in one of our major parties. It manifests not only in words but in actions.The style of authoritarianism of the Trump movement cannot be fully understood without taking into account the movement’s racism. President Trump has labeled Mexicans rapists, invented stories about New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11, and said there were “very fine people” among the white nationalists in Charlottesville. His administration has attempted to ban large numbers of Muslims from entering the country, held Latino migrant children in squalid detention centers, and gutted the Justice Department’s civil rights division. Study after study has found that Trump’s most loyal voters are defined by unusually high levels of racial resentment and animus. Trump himself, per Axios, seems to think that his 2020 reelection depends on rallying racist voters to his cause with outbursts like the one targeting Omar.Racism powers the authoritarianism: It helps identify who the enemies are, determines which people need to be crushed by Trump and his Republican allies. The authoritarian idea of using law to punish political enemies and the racist idea that the rising nonwhite population threatens something essential about America have together been at the core of Trumpism almost since the get-go. Omar — a black, immigrant, Muslim, Democratic woman — is such a movement’s perfect target.She is a naturalized citizen, of course, so Trump couldn’t just order Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “send her back.” But the call to deport Omar has a symbolic purpose; it serves as a rallying cry for those who feel Trump ought to be targeting people like her for legal sanction. It is an extreme expression of demographic anxiety, of fear of the loss of white America’s dominant status and a willingness to consider even authoritarian means to slow or reverse this decline.The campaign promise to bar Muslims from entering the United States, made manifest almost immediately after Trump took office via the “travel ban” executive order, was a blatant example of this principle. The initial policy was so broadly worded that it seemed to bar people with green cards from the travel ban countries from reentering if they happened to be out of it. This is a moral absurdity: In what world could it possibly be fair to bar people who already had permission to reside, long-term, in the US? But it makes sense if you view the purpose of law through a “send her back” lens. The purpose of the legal tools is not to be fair but to hurt the right people (in this case, Muslims).Trump had to quickly back down from the ban’s application to green card holders, and many of the other more sweeping parts of the first travel ban were defeated in court. But the pattern — that the law be pushed and twisted as far as possible to exclude nonwhite individuals from the physical nation or its political life — was set.That pattern has since grown to include the Trump administration separating children from parents at the border and making it difficult to seek asylum despite America’s commitments to openness under international and domestic law. It explains why he attempted to include a question about citizenship on the census, a question to suppress the number of immigrants counted in it — and, when the courts told him he couldn’t, briefly tried to do it anyway.It remains to be seen what further actions Trump will take along these lines up until the 2020 election, and the long-term consequences of such actions for American democracy. But the fact is that the president seems to see the “send her back” chanters as his base, and the GOP is perfectly willing to let him court them because they care more about beating Democrats. There is no reason to believe that any of this will end well.


 TALLAHASSEE — Fueled by millions of dollars from unknown sources, an obscure petition drive declared victory this week and announced that a new constitutional amendment to require only citizens to vote in Florida — something that’s already required by law — has more than twice the number of signatures needed to get on the 2020 election ballot. “Over 1,300,000 petition signatures have been collected to ensure Citizen Voters Amendment will appear on the 2020 ballot,’’ the organization said on its web site. The feat was fast, since the group just formed nine months ago and raised and spent $2.4 million, but its confidence may be a bit premature. The Florida Citizen Voters proposal still needs to pass a Florida Supreme Court review on whether it is misleading to ask voters to make something illegal if it’s already illegal. But just as a new law took effect July 7, declaring that petition signatures are invalid if they are not certified within 30 days, Citizen Voters unloaded hundreds of thousands of petitions to county elections offices and ensured one thing: elections officials are scrambling to verify them by the deadline. They’re calling it the “big dump” — and some are asking if it was intentional, especially organizers of an amendment to deregulate the utility industry who suspect this is a tactic intended to undermine their effort. “It’s costing around $120,000 in extra costs for us to bring in 14 temps and to pay our full-time staff overtime to make sure we get them done under the new 30-day deadline,’’ said Bill Cowles, Orange County supervisor of elections. Florida law requires that for a citizen’s initiative to be on the ballot, it must collect 766,200 signatures, including a specified amount from every congressional district. But under the new law, any petition group that holds onto a signature for more than 30 days can face steep penalties, including fines of up to $1,000 for “willfully” not meeting deadline and the threat of getting sued by the Florida Attorney General’s office. Petition groups pay an hourly fee to reimburse some of the elections’ officials costs, but several election officials said it does not cover all expenses. In Osceola County, which has a population of around 350,000, Elections Supervisor Mary Jane Arrington said the county received a single delivery of 25,000 individually signed petitions from the Citizen Voters campaign, forcing its modest staff of 16 to work long hours and weekends to verify the signature of each registered voters in the time allotted. “They made a big dump, as we call it, right before the new deadline,” Arrington said. “With a county of our size, we worked overtime this past weekend and we will be working overtime this next weekend to get them done in the 30 days.” John Loudon, director of the Citizen Voters campaign, said that after the new law took effect his organization “tried to deliver as many petitions as possible days before the deadline” and “will now deliver the remaining petitions to the various counties as quickly as possible.” In Lee County, more than 35,000 petitions came from the Citizen Voters campaign in a single shipment, which filing officer Cheryl Futch said is an anomaly. “We have to adjust our budget to provide for that,” she said. “We’re just not used to getting this amount at once.” In larger counties, the influx is more easily absorbed. Broward County Supervisor of Elections Pete Antonacci hired seven part-time employees to help with the 128,000 Citizen Voters petitions it received. In Pinellas County, elections officials there have hired 14 additional staff to handle the Citizen Voters petitions, and Hillsborough County is ramping up with temporary workers to verify 100,000 Citizen Voters signatures. “We just have such a flexible staff that we’re able to accommodate this,’’ said Dustin Chase, spokesperson for Pinellas County’s elections supervisor. For Arrington, the Citizens petition is “redundant” and a “drain” on taxpayers resources. “You already have to be a citizen to register to vote,” she said. “It’s hurting my budget, and I haven’t planned for overtime in an off year.” The amendment would replace one word in the Florida Constitution with two new ones. Right now, only citizens can vote but the current wording states “every citizen” can vote. The proposed wording says “only a citizen” can vote. Alex Patton, chairman of another ballot initiative — a Texas-style energy choice petition that proposes to deregulate Florida’s monopolized utility system — said he believes the Citizen Voters proposal is not only redundant, it is a tactic employed by a shadowy campaign run by the utility giants to sabotage his initiative. “I think their initial plan was to clog the supervisor of elections offices as our initiative got close to being at the end,’’ he said. The new law’s 30-day countdown, however, messed with that plan and they were forced to dump everything, Patton said. He is suspicious because of the tactics used by monopoly utilities in 2016 when they proposed an initiative aimed at confusing voters and undercutting a solar-industry backed initiative to encourage rooftop solar expansion. The rival amendments led to a bidding war for petition gatherers and, according to court records, when the price per signature reached $5.25 in December 2015, the pro-solar group was forced to call it quits and pull its amendment. The utilities then spent more than $20 million on their campaign to frustrate the expansion of consumer-owned rooftop solar in Florida. Voters rejected it. “We have seen and we have observed and we have been told that this is all connected to obstructing our path to the ballot,’’ said Patton, chair of Citizens for Energy Choices. “There’s only one group with the means and the motive to do that. And that’s the monopoly utilities. I blame the monopoly utilities.” Neither Florida Power and Light, Tampa Electric Company nor Duke Energy responded to repeated requests for comment made through multiple emails, texts and phone calls over two days. FPL wanted to punish disloyal customers by withholding solar. Then that changed. Loudon, a former Missouri state lawmaker who lives in Palm Beach County, denied that he is working with any other group. “Florida Citizen Voters is the only political effort we are working on in the state of Florida,’’ he said, adding that Colorado is next on the target list. But he acknowledged that all his money has come from a single group, Florida-based Citizen Voters, Inc., also run by Loudon. When the Times/Herald asked him to disclose who funds the group, he refused. “Citizen Voters and Florida Citizen Voters complies to every requirement for disclosure,’’ he said. Citizen Voters, Inc. registered as a non-profit in 2018 but skirted IRS disclosure laws by not collecting money until 2019, and it does not have to disclose its sources of income until May 2020. Campaign experts say that petition dumping is a tactic used in other states to block initiatives from getting on the ballot. If opponents can prevent a ballot measure from reaching the ballot through a successful blocking campaign, they can save a considerable amount of money that they would otherwise have to spend to persuade voters to vote no during a general election. In Colorado, a blocking campaign popped up in response to two ballot initiatives that had to do with regulating oil and gas activity and creating mandatory 2,500-foot setbacks between certain energy development like fracking and houses, schools and water sources. One key player behind blocking campaigns and petitions is a professional signature gatherer from California named Mark Jacoby. He runs a Facebook network of 1,500 professional signature gatherers called Let the Voters Decide, and a Fullerton, California-based firm of the same name which was paid $2.2 million by Citizen Voters, Inc. for “canvassing” services. Before Let the Voters Decide, Jacoby operated a private consulting firm called YPM, or Young Political Majors. In 2004, he registered the company in Hillsborough County and worked to switch scores of college students’ voters registration from Democrat to Republican. Florida officials said that about 4,000 students may have been improperly registered at the University of Florida, Florida A&M University and Florida State University, the St. Petersburg Times reported then. The Tampa elections office also got calls from University of South Florida students who complained that canvassers deceived them. Jacoby was arrested for voter fraud in 2008 after dozens of voters in California told police that they were duped into registering as Republicans by people employed by Jacoby’s firm, the Los Angeles Times reported then. Dan Fessler, a professional petition gatherer, worked on the Colorado campaign alongside Jacoby, his former friend and longtime business associate. He said Florida Citizens Vote, which paid Jacoby $2.2 million in-kind “contributions,” is running the same playbook. “The Citizens [Citizen Voters] petition was never intended as a normal petition,” Fessler said. “It was 100 percent conceived for the sole purpose of making sure that the energy petition fails.” Patton has run into other issues with the Citizen Voters campaign, like suddenly losing contracts with petition gathering firms because of “conflicts of interest” or losing staff to the Citizen Voters initiative, which offered more money per signature than he could pay. He calls it “anti-competitive” behavior, and says there’s only one group with the motive and means to get behind the effort. “I can’t legally prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt,” he said. “I blame the monopoly utilities.” Both Citizen Voters, Inc. and Florida Citizen Voters are run by Loudon and were established by Erika Alba, the Jacksonville-based director of public affairs for Foley and Lardner, a Broward County-based law firm. Alba is also the general counsel for Associated Industries of Florida, the business-backed lobbying group that does not disclose its top donors but has been known to lobby and campaign on behalf of the state’s utility industry among other top industries. Alba played an active role in the 2018 election, serving as the head of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Super PAC, Fund for Florida’s Future. She also formed two political committees whose source of funds are harder to trace because they, like Citizen Voters, Inc., are not-for-profits and are shielded by federal and state dark money laws: Florida Seniors First financed almost $450,000 in mailers in August 2018. Count My Vote raised and spent $1.2 million between September and December 2018, including more than $550,000 in “printing services” from Jacoby’s “Let the Voters Decide” organization in California. Loudon wrote an opinion piece for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel which appeared Wednesday. In it he defends his petition by alleging nationwide efforts to grant voting rights to non-citizens. There is no such effort underway in Florida. In an email Wednesday, Loudon clarified that his worry is not that non-citizens are voting illegally, but that the “extreme left” is advocating for the illegal act. “They’re calling non-citizen voting ‘the newest civil right,’ ” he wrote. “We want to proactively ensure elections in every state in the United States are preserved for committed citizens of the United States.” Cowles, the Orange County supervisor of elections, said he sees the rise of petitions and citizen initiatives as political tactics, and he believes there is a need for reform. “Maybe we should have our elections with these initiatives and amendments in November in the off year and maybe we should do it by mail,’’ he said. “How many of these are on the ballot as campaign tools? If you move them off the ballot then voters would only see candidates in the even years.”Former Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau chief, co-bureau chief of Herald/Times bureauTimes/Herald Tallahassee Bureau staff writerVice President Mike Pence is on to this 50-year anniversary celebration.Gov.

Average thermometer readings around the globe reached previously unseen highs, making June 2019 the hottest June on record, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 


Besides Xeon processors that are officially mentioned on its website and price list, Intel has tens of ‘off roadmap’ server CPUs only available to select customers that have special requests. Recently journalists from ComputerBase discovered that Intel has Xeon Platinum 8284, the company’s fastest 28-core chip for multi-socket servers. The CPU runs 300 MHz faster than the ‘official’ Xeon Platinum 8280, but costs considerably more.Intel’s Xeon Platinum 8284 packs 28 cores with Hyper-Threading that run at 3.0-4.0 GHz, feature a 38.5 MB cache, a six-channel memory controller supporting up to 1 TB of DDR4-2933 with ECC, 48 PCIe 3.0 lanes, and other capabilities found in codenamed Cascade Lake CPUs. Since the chip runs at 300 MHz higher base frequency when compared to the Xeon Platinum 8280, it has a 240 W TDP, up from 205 W. Meanwhile, Tcase of the CPU (the maximum allowed temperature on the IHS of the processor) was reduced to 65°C (down from 84°C), so the CPU requires a very sophisticated cooling system that can take away 240 W at the aforementioned temperature.Being Intel’s fastest 28-core CPU for multi-socket servers, the Xeon Platinum 8284 processor costs $15,460 (recommended customer price for 1k unit order, RCP), whereas the Xeon Platinum 8280 that runs at a 300 MHz lower frequency, costs $10,009 for 1ku.The Xeon Platinum 8284 is not mentioned in Intel’s pricelist, and not under Cascade Lake on Intel's ARK database, but it is searchable if you know the exact number. This typically means that the CPU is only available to select customers or even a customer. That said, it is possible that apart from higher clocks, this 'semi-custom' off-roadmap processor may come with features that go beyond that and this might explain the huge price difference when compared to the model 8280.Source: Intel’s ARK (via ComputerBase)

Thirteen astronomical observatories that call the mountain home have evacuated workers and curtailed their operations.Work on the TMT was set to resume on 15 July after a four-year delay caused by legal challenges and protests. Hawaii’s state supreme court ruled in October that the TMT’s construction permit was valid. But last weekend, opponents of the telescope began gathering at a site at the base of the access road that leads up Mauna Kea. They sang, held signs and spoke out against the TMT, which they believe will further despoil a sacred mountain.“I honestly don’t know how this is going to end,” says Doug Simons, an astronomer and executive director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, one of the observatories on the mountain.The observatories on Mauna Kea’s summit — which include some of the world’s largest, such as the twin 10-metre Keck telescopes and the 8.2-metre Subaru Telescope — stopped collecting data and ordered employees and researchers to evacuate on 16 July.Affected projects include Andrea Ghez’s ongoing studies of the centre of the Milky Way. Ghez, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles, had planned to use one of the Keck telescopes on 16 July to collect data on the motion of stars around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Galaxy. Scientists use such information to test predictions of general relativity.But Ghez isn’t bothered by Keck’s temporary closure. “If I lose a night in order that everyone can figure out how to move forward in the long run, that’s far more important than one night of observing,” she says. Mihoko Konishi, an astronomer at Oita University in Japan, had planned to use the Subaru Telescope between 16 and 18 July to study disks of planet-forming dust and gas around other stars. “I know Mauna Kea is a sanctuary for Hawaiians, so I hope [for] a peaceful settlement for both sides as quickly as possible,” Konishi says.Some of the telescopes atop Mauna Kea can be operated remotely, without staff on-site. But facility managers opted not to do that in case something went wrong that observatory staff couldn’t handle from afar. “We anticipate returning to normal operations as soon as the situation allows,” said Jessica Dempsey, deputy director of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, in a 16 July statement.Hawaii governor David Ige signed an emergency proclamation on 17 July that allowed law enforcement to close more sections of road around the base of Mauna Kea. By then, TMT opponents had established a pu’uhonua — ‘place of refuge’ in Hawaiian — and started flying the Hawaiian flag upside-down as a sign of distress. Seven protestors had chained themselves to a cattle grate in the road leading up to the summit on 15 July, although they later detached themselves. “Our objective is to stop TMT,” said Kaho’okahi Kanuha, a leader of the protestors, during a 16 July press conference. “We’re against the destruction of our mauna,” or mountain.Ige has said that opponents who block access to the TMT construction site are breaking the law. Police took 33 Native Hawaiian elders into custody on 17 July before citing and releasing them almost immediately.Astronomy graduate students published an open letter on 17 July asking, among other things, for the state to withdraw law enforcement officers from Mauna Kea. As of 18 July, hundreds of astronomers have signed it.“We have been trying to balance and maintain access to Mauna Kea in a way that would be respectful,” Ige said in a press conference on 17 July. He added that Native Hawaiian practitioners have long revered the mountain, and visit it for sacred ceremonies.Other demonstrations related to the TMT project — mostly opposing it — have broken out across the Hawaiian islands in the past few days, including in the state’s capital of Honolulu.Latest on:Astronomical instrumentationNews 11 JUL 19Letter 02 JUL 19Books & Arts 26 JUN 19Astronomy and astrophysicsNews 16 JUL 19News 11 JUL 19Research Highlight 11 JUL 19Sign up for the daily Nature Briefing email newsletterStay up to date with what matters in science and why, handpicked from Nature and other publications worldwide.Sign UpAdvanced searchISSN 1476-4687 (online)© 2019 Springer Nature Publishing AG

PITTSBURGH – A federal grand jury on July 17 returned a three-count indictment (the Indictment) against Mustafa Mousab Alowemer, 21, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in connection with his planned attack on a Christian church in Pittsburgh, United States Attorney Scott W. Brady announced today. The Indictment charges Alowemer with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a designated foreign terrorist organization, and two counts of distributing information relating to an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass destruction.Alowemer was initially arrested on a Complaint on June 19, 2019, and appeared before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Cynthia Reed Eddy. Alowemer was ordered detained and has been in federal custody since his arrest.As alleged in the Indictment and complaint:The FBI Pittsburgh JTTF investigation of Alowemer revealed that Alowemer plotted to bomb a church located on the North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (the Church), using a weapon of mass destruction (i.e., an explosive device). According to Alowemer, his motivation to detonate a device at the Church was to support the cause of ISIS and to inspire other ISIS supporters in the United States to join together and commit similar acts in the name of ISIS. Alowemer also targeted the Church in order to "take revenge for our [ISIS] brothers in Nigeria." Alowemer was aware that numerous people in the proximity of the Church could be killed by the explosion.According to the complaint, Alowemer was born in Daraa, Syria, and has resided in the United States since August 2016.In furtherance of the plot to bomb the Church, in May 2019, Alowemer distributed multiple instructional documents related to the construction and use of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to an individual Alowemer believed to be a fellow ISIS supporter, but who was in fact an FBI employee. Alowemer distributed these documents with the intent that the information be used in the assembly of a destructive device and in furtherance of conducting an attack in support of ISIS. In or around June 2019, Alowemer purchased several items with the belief that they were necessary to assemble a destructive device and with theintention that they be used to construct the explosives that would be detonated in the vicinity of the Church.Between April 16 and June 11, Alowemer met four times in person with an FBI Undercover Employee (UCE) and/or an FBI Confidential Human Source (CHS). At the June 11 meeting with the UCE and CHS, Alowemer provided additional details about the bomb plot and provided the materials, including boxes of nails, he had purchased for construction of the device. Alowemer provided two printed copies of detailed Google satellite maps, which included hand-written markings identifying the Church and routes of arrival and escape. Alowemer also wrote and provided a 10-point handwritten plan ("Confirmation of this operation") outlining details related to his plot to personally deliver explosives in a backpack. Alowemer expressed a desire to meet one more time to conduct planning and coordination prior to carrying out the attempted bombing in July 2019. That meeting was later scheduled for June 19 in the Pittsburgh area, at which time Alowemer was arrested.The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.If convicted, each count has a 20-year maximum term of imprisonment. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed would be based upon the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force who were directly involved in this investigation include: FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE)/U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services(USCIS)/Homeland Security Investigations(HSI), Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation, United States Secret Service, United States Postal Inspection Service, Pennsylvania State Police, Allegheny County Police Department, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Allegheny County Port Authority Police, Allegheny County Probation, University of Pittsburgh Police Department, and UPMC Police Security.The case is being prosecuted by the Western District of Pennsylvania’s National Security Coordinator Assistant U.S. Attorney Soo C. Song, with assistance from Trial Attorney Brenda Sue Thornton of the Department of Justice’s National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.  Learn about victim notification and rights, witness information, and helpful resources.

CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againCommentary: Our inability to draw lines when it comes to our personal data is a real problem, with real ramifications. This won't age well.FaceApp lets users upload a picture, then alter it to look older, younger or like another gender.I woke up, poured some coffee and, as I often do each morning, checked Twitter. There, among the headlines, were faces. Old faces, young faces, weird faces. Altered faces of friends, colleagues and strangers, all of them using FaceApp, the latest viral trend. God forbid we miss out on any of those. "Why on earth are you still tweeting FaceApp pics?" I asked one of them. This person, a tech writer I think highly of, explained that some of the people they like the most who cover questions of future surveillance seemed to think that privacy issues with FaceApp are overblown.    Are they? FaceApp's privacy policy makes it clear that the app pulls data like your location, IP address and log file information for the purpose of aiming targeted ads at you. With data like that, advertisers could aim ads at users in specific regions, for instance. "We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners," the policy reads. "This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you." Targeted ads aren't anything new, of course -- and neither is FaceApp, which has been around for two years now. Aviran Hazum, head of Analysis and Response at the security research firm Check Point Research, tells CNET that he didn't find anything out of the ordinary when he took a closer look at how FaceApp works. "This app seems to be developed in a good fashion," Hazum writes. "No greedy permissions, and it does what they claim it does." Read more: Amazon and Google are listening to your voice recordings. Here's what we know about that But now, FaceApp is going viral once more, with millions of people downloading it in order to participate in an internet craze. And it's hard to blame them -- the tech is scarily good. Who wouldn't want to see and share a stunning representation of what they might look like in 30 years? I know I was tempted. After all, ads are already targeted at me every day because of products and services I already willingly use. What's the harm in a few more of those ads if I'm getting to try out some cutting-edge tech in the process? But I read that privacy policy before downloading the app, and it gave me a lot of pause. Then, I saw FaceApp's terms of service, which include the following: You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed, without compensation to you. 	A reminder that terms like these aren't written for your benefit. They're written to cover potential legal liabilities while sharing as little as possible about what a company is actually doing with your data -- and I'd add that you can find similar catchalls in the terms and conditions for apps and services like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. You click accept without reading, and the company can say, "it's not our fault, you were warned." And in this case, we were. We've known that FaceApp is controversial for some time now. We know that facial recognition is troubling and that deepfake technology can be used to create stunningly realistic videos of a person using nothing more than a single image of their face. "Privacy invasions often sneak in through 'fun' disguises," CNET cybersecurity and privacy reporter Alfred Ng tells me, pointing out that Cambridge Analytica got all the data it needed using quirky personality quizzes. "It's important for people not to fall for these traps. It's like Hansel and Gretel and the candy house." We also know that FaceApp is a Russian company, and that Russian intelligence weaponized social media in order to spread propaganda during the 2016 US presidential election. Prominent Democrats and Republicans say that FaceApp is a cause for concern that merits further scrutiny. I don't advocate hysteria, and I don't think that anyone should automatically assume that an app or service is nefarious simply because it's based out of Moscow -- but I do support skepticism. Perhaps we ought to take heed.BIG: Share if you used #FaceApp:The @FBI & @FTC must look into the national security & privacy risks nowBecause millions of Americans have used itIt’s owned by a Russia-based companyAnd users are required to provide full, irrevocable access to their personal photos & data pic.twitter.com/cejLLwBQcrSo let me repeat the question I asked this morning: Why are we still using this app? Even if you take FaceApp at its word that it's not uploading all of your photos, the company still says troubling things, like promising that it deletes most -- but not all -- user images after 48 hours. OK... What is it doing with the images it keeps? Another good question: What sort of vetting do Apple and Google do before hosting apps like FaceApp that collect user data in order to deliver targeted ads? Is there any extra scrutiny of apps like these that are based out of Russia? I've asked both companies these questions, and will update this space with on-the-record responses if I receive them. "Users want more control and transparency over how their personal information is being used by applications, and expect Android, as the platform, to do more to provide that control and transparency," Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play, wrote in a recent blog post. "This responsibility to users is something we have always taken seriously, and that's why we are taking a comprehensive look at how our platform and policies reflect that commitment." "We have strict policies on how app developers can handle user data," a Google spokesperson adds, pointing out that when a violation is found, the company takes action. Playing it safe and saying thanks but no thanks to FaceApp should be an easy call. But everything is relative, and it's unfair to zero in on one problematic app when the entire internet is riddled with glaring privacy concerns, to the point where we've grown somewhat numb to them.   As one headline put it, "Think FaceApp is scary? Wait until you hear about Facebook." In other words, anyone concerned with FaceApp ought to be concerned with the entire app ecosystem -- and maybe it's a good thing that the FaceApp hubbub is drawing more attention to the larger issue at hand. In that sense, concerns about FaceApp and FaceApp alone probably are somewhat overblown. But let's be careful not to shrug this one off. For most of us, sacrificing some privacy in order to enjoy the fruits of the internet is unavoidable, but unless we see larger action toward regulating these sorts of data privacy concerns, we'll need to get much, much better at drawing lines for ourselves.  Call me a killjoy, but maybe that means taking a pass on posting pics of what we'll look like in 30 years. Personally, I'm more concerned about what the state of privacy will look like in 30 years. I don't need AI to show me that it ain't pretty.

The London Metropolitan Police's spectacular run of failure continues. Sky News reports the latest data shows the Met's facial recognition tech is still better at fucking up than doing what it says on the tin.

Researchers found that the controversial system is 81% inaccurate - meaning that, in the vast majority of cases, it flagged up faces to police when they were not on a wanted list.

Needless to say, this has raised "significant concerns" by the sort of people most likely to be concerned about false positives. Needless to say, this does not include the London Metropolitan Police, which continues to deploy this tech despite its only marginally-improved failure rate.

In 2018, it was reported the Metropolitan Police's tech was misidentifying people at an astounding 100% rate. False positives were apparently the only thing the system was capable of. Things had improved by May 2019, bringing the Met's false positive rate down to 96%. The sample size was still pretty small, meaning this had a negligible effect on the possibility of the Metropolitan Police rounding up the unusual suspects the system claimed were the usual suspects.

Perhaps this should be viewed as a positive development, but when a system has only managed to work its way up to being wrong 81% of the time, we should probably hold our applause until the end of the presentation.

As it stands now, the tech is better at being wrong than identifying criminals. But what's just as concerning is the Met's unshaken faith in its failing tech. It defends its facial recognition software with stats that are literally unbelievable.

The Met police insists its technology makes an error in only one in 1,000 instances, but it hasn’t shared its methodology for arriving at that statistic.

This much lower error rate springs from Metropolitan Police's generous accounting of its facial recognition program. Its method compares successful and unsuccessful matches with the total number of faces processed. That's how it arrives at a failure rate that sounds much, much better than a system that is far more often wrong than right.

No matter which math is used, it's not acceptable to deploy tech that's wrong so often when the public is routinely stripped of its agency by secret discussions and quiet rollouts. Here in the US, two cities have banned this tech, citing its unreliability and the potential harms caused by its deployment. Out in London, law enforcement has never been told "No." A city covered by cameras is witnessing surveillance mission creep utilizing notoriously unreliable tech.

The tech is being challenged in court by Big Brother Watch, which points out that every new report of the tech's utter failure only strengthens its case. Government officials, however, aren't so sure. And by "not so sure," I mean, "mired in deep denial."

The Home Office defended the Met, telling Sky News: "We support the police as they trial new technologies to protect the public, including facial recognition, which can help them identity criminals.

But it clearly does not do that.

It misidentifies people as criminals, which isn't even remotely close to "identifying criminals." It's the exact opposite and it's going to harm London residents. And the government offers nothing but shrugs and empty assurances of public safety.

 According to the Met, 999 of 1000 are correctly identified, and if 19% of the 1/1000 are correctly identified as criminals then there are only 19 criminals per 100,000 people, which is easily the lowest rate in London, let alone in the world.

Filed under:The city has paused Navya’s trail pending a full investigationA self-driving bus trial taking place in Vienna, Austria, has been paused after an incident occurred between a pedestrian and one of the vehicles, reports Bloomberg. On Thursday morning a 30-year-old woman collided with the bus, which is operated by the self-driving startup Navya, sustaining minor injuries. The city’s transit authority has paused the trials of the two autonomous buses while it awaits the results of an investigation into the incident. It’s currently unclear who was at fault for the collision. State broadcaster ORF reported that the bus was moving at about 7.5 miles an hour when it struck the knee of a woman, according to Bloomberg. In a statement given to The Verge, Navya claimed that witnesses had seen the pedestrian wearing headphones and looking at a mobile phone as she crossed the street and “walked against” the side of the bus. Golem reported a similar account from an eyewitness. Navya said the woman suffered “minor scratches” as a result of the incident. “Even though this incident ended without too much damage, we take it seriously. We are already analyzing the logs of the incidents in order to shed light on what happened. For this reason, the buses remain in the garage until they are clarified,” Navya said, adding that it intends to release a final report later today.Regardless of who is at fault, it’s an unfortunate setback for the French startup, which has already run other autonomous bus trials in dozens of cities around the globe. Navya did not immediately confirm the status of its other trials, or whether they have been suspended in the wake of the incident. Vienna’s trial has only been operating since June 6, and includes a professional driver on-board each bus as a backup in case of any problems.Even though the pedestrian’s injuries were reportedly minor, the incident is likely to be heavily scrutinized by regulators who are wary of safety concerns surrounding the emerging autonomous vehicle industry. Last year the industry was rocked by a fatal collision in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving car, although Uber later resumed its tests that year. A state attorney has since announced that Uber will not be charged with a crime as a result of the incident, which occurred while the backup driver was reportedly watching Hulu.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.


Basil Al Jarah pleaded guilty after investigation into alleged bribery involving Monaco firm

Last modified on Fri 19 Jul 2019 09.43 EDT

A businessman has admitted his part in an international corruption conspiracy following a criminal investigation into alleged bribery in the energy industry.Basil Al Jarah, 70, from Hull, pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiring to give corrupt payments to public officials to secure commercial contracts in Iraq at Southwark crown court, London.It is the first guilty plea to result from a three-year investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into suspected bribery and money laundering involving a Monaco-based oil and gas firm Unaoil.Al Jarah, described by the SFO as Unaoil’s former partner in Iraq, pleaded guilty on Monday. His admission can be reported after a legal restriction was lifted on Friday.According to the SFO, the five counts relate to conduct between 2005 and 2013, and the award of contracts to supply and install single-point moorings and oil pipelines in southern Iraq. Three other individuals have pleaded not guilty and will face trial next year.The indictment placed before the court also names other people and companies Al Jarah is said to have acted with. No charges have been laid against those other people or businesses, and being named in the indictment does not constitute proof of guilt.Named in connection with all five counts are three members of the Ahsani family who formerly owned and controlled Unaoil – Ata, the firm’s founder, and his two sons Cyrus and Saman.The Ahsanis have denied any wrongdoing in connection with the work of Unaoil and described the allegations against the firm as malicious and damaging.Last month, it emerged that the SFO has dropped its investigation into the Ahsani family, although its investigation into Unaoil continues. The SFO declined to explain its decision to stop investigating the family.Also named in the indictment against Al Jarah is Ahmed al-Jibouri, the chief executive and founder of a Jordanian energy consultancy. Al Jarah is accused of acting with al-Jibouri to give corrupt payments to Iraqi officials in connection with two contracts.Al-Jibouri has previously described the allegations against him and his company, Armada Group, as baseless and said he has hired a law firm to investigate the journalists at the Australian media group Fairfax, which originally reported the allegations against Unaoil.


SectionsPakistan PM Imran Khan will visit the United States, meet Donald Trump next week (File Photo)Ahead of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to the United States, a Congressional report has said that the security assistance to Pakistan would remain suspended pending "decisive and irreversible" action against terrorist groups.At the direction of US President Donald Trump, the United States had suspended all its security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018. This is first high-level visit by a Pakistani prime minster to the White House during the Trump administration."Pakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, and successive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even supported some of these as proxies in Islamabad's historical conflicts with its neighbors," the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in a latest report on Pakistan.The CRS is an independent and bipartisan research wing of the the US Congress, which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest for lawmakers to make informed decisions. Its reports are prepared by eminent experts of the field and are not considered as an official view of the US Congress.The latest CRS report told lawmakers that the 2011 revelation that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had enjoyed years-long refuge in Pakistan led to intensive US government scrutiny of the bilateral relationship. It also sparked congressional questioning of the wisdom of providing significant aid to a nation that may not have the intention or capacity to be an effective partner.The Trump administration has taken a harder line on Pakistan than its predecessors, sharply cutting assistance and suspending security-related aid, said the CRS report dated July 15."The United States continues to press for decisive and irreversible action against externally-focused terror groups and UN-designated terrorist organizations operating from its territory," it said. "Pending such action, security assistance will remain suspended."During a September 2018 visit to Islamabad amidst talk of a "reset" of bilateral ties, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed hope that the US could find common ground with Pakistan's new leadership, but mutual distrust was seen to be pervasive in the relationship and American leverage was much reduced.In mid-2017, the administration announced that it would "pause" disbursement of USD 255 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and announced a broader security aid suspension in January 2018. According to the State Department, about USD 790 million in unobligated FMF dating back to 2001 is affected.Pakistani politicians and analysts of all stripes decried what they perceived as an effort to scapegoat their country for US policy failures in Afghanistan.The administration's 2020 budget request for assistance to Pakistan totals about USD 70 million, including USD 48 million for economic and development aid.Noting that numerous indigenous terrorist groups operate on or from Pakistani territoryor areas under its occupation, many designated as 'Foreign Terrorist Organisations' under the US law, the CRS said incidents of domestic terrorism decreased since the Pakistan Army launched major operations in 2014.However, some externally-oriented terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba continue to operate freely, by some accounts even supported by state elements. Al Qaeda and ISIS networks are also present in Pakistan, it said.According to the report, Pakistan's continued conflict and rivalry with India is unabated, with international fears about the possibility of war between two nuclear-armed powers.The report also notes that the Trump administration had noted Pakistan's growing debt to China and expressed opposition to any bailout that would go to reducing Chinese debt.Pakistan's Finance Ministry denies that the IMF funds would be used to repay Chinese debt and it is seeking to renegotiate aspects of the so-called "China-Pakistan Economic Corridor" or "CPEC" to reduce long-term debt, the CRS said.The so-called "CPEC" is a corridor being built to connect Pakistan with China through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or PoK. The project has been strongly opposed by India as it passes through PoK, which is part of Jammu and Kashmir - India's northernmost state. Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

amym@rice.eduLost glacier to be honored with memorial monument
Climate change blamed for glacier’s meltingHOUSTON – (July 18, 2019) – Iceland’s first glacier lost to climate change will be remembered with a monument to be unveiled next month at the site of the former glacier.Researchers from Rice University in Houston, author Andri Snær Magnason and geologist Oddur Sigurðsson will join members of the Icelandic Hiking Society and the general public Aug. 18 to install a monument recognizing the site of the former Okjökull glacier in Borgarfjörður, Iceland.The melted glacier was the subject of the 2018 documentary “Not Ok,” produced by Rice anthropologists Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer. The film, narrated by former Reykjavík Mayor Jón Gnarr, tells the story of “Ok,” which in 2014 became the first glacier in Iceland to lose its title because of global warming. Boyer and Howe said scientists fear all of the island nation’s 400-plus glaciers will be gone by 2200.“This will be the first monument to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world,” Howe said. “By marking Ok’s passing, we hope to draw attention to what is being lost as Earth’s glaciers expire. These bodies of ice are the largest freshwater reserves on the planet and frozen within them are histories of the atmosphere. They are also often important cultural forms that are full of significance.”“In the same spirit as the film, we wanted to create a lasting memorial to Ok, a small glacier that has a big story to tell,” Boyer said. “Ok was the first named Icelandic glacier to melt because of how humans have transformed the planet’s atmosphere. Its fate will be shared by all of Iceland’s glaciers unless we act now to radically curtail greenhouse gas emissions.”The film celebrated its world premiere at Bíó Paradís Cinema in Reykjavík last August, and the film’s creators hosted an “Un-Glacier Tour” to view the remnants of Okjökull. A second “Un-Glacier Tour” will lead participants to the site where the monument will be installed. Those interested in joining the tour may RSVP online at https://www.notokmovie.com.Howe and Boyer hope the monument will raise awareness about the decline of Iceland’s glaciers and the impact of climate change.“One of our Icelandic colleagues put it very wisely when he said, ‘Memorials are not for the dead; they are for the living,'” Howe said. “With this memorial, we want to underscore that it is up to us, the living, to collectively respond to the rapid loss of glaciers and the ongoing impacts of climate change. For Ok glacier it is already too late; it is now what scientists call ‘dead ice.'”Media interested in attending either event or interviewing Boyer or Howe may contact Amy McCaig, senior media relations specialist at Rice, at 713-348-6777 or amym@rice.edu.-30-This news release can be found online at news.rice.edu.Follow Rice News and Media Relations on Twitter @RiceUNews.Related materials:Not OK movie website: https://www.notokmovie.com/Photo links:A photo of the monument to be installed Aug. 18.https://news-network.rice.edu/news/files/2019/07/image1.jpgA photo of the former glacier Okjökull.https://news-network.rice.edu/news/files/2018/07/OK-1o5tg6h.gifPhoto credits: Dominic Boyer/Cymene HoweLocated on a 300-acre forested campus in Houston, Rice University is consistently ranked among the nation’s top 20 universities by U.S. News & World Report.

The chant was widely condemned, and Trump later tried to distance himself from it, saying, "I was not happy with it. I disagree with it."On Friday, however, he blasted the press's "crazed" coverage of the rally, saying not enough attention is paid to past "vile and disgusting statements" from the lawmakers.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.


Congressmember Omar introduced a bill Wednesday that would protect the right of people to use boycotts to effect social change. House Resolution 496 reads, in part, “Boycotts have been effectively used in the United States by advocates for equal rights since the Boston Tea Party and include boycotts led by civil rights activists during the 1950s and 1960s in order to advocate for racial equality, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, and promote workers’ rights, such as the United Farm Workers-led boycott of table grapes.” The bill is co-sponsored by Georgia Congressmember John Lewis and Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, another of the four congresswomen cited by Trump in recent racist attacks. This comes as congressmembers of both major parties have pledged support to a nonbinding resolution that would condemn the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions—or BDS—movement against Israel over its human rights abuses and its occupation of Palestinian lands.

 Washington • President Donald Trump on Thursday chided his supporters who chanted “send her back” when he questioned the loyalty of a Somali-born congresswoman, joining widespread criticism of the campaign crowd’s cry and his Republican allies worried about political blowback from the angry scene. In a week that has corkscrewed daily with hostile exchanges over race and love of country , Trump also claimed he had tried to stop the chant at a reelection event Wednesday night in North Carolina — though video shows otherwise. The crowd's "send her back" shouts resounded for 13 seconds as Trump made no attempt to interrupt them. He paused in his speech and surveyed the scene, taking in the uproar. "I started speaking really quickly," he told reporters Thursday. "I was not happy with it. I disagree with it" and "would certainly try" to stop any similar chant at a future rally. The taunt's target — Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — was pressed for a response on Thursday. "This is what this president and his supporters have turned our country" into, she said as she walked outside the U.S. Capitol. "This is not about me. This is about fighting about what this country truly should be and what it deserves to be." "I believe he is fascist," she said. The freshman congresswoman, a hijab-wearing Muslim, has fast become a leading face of the resistance to Trump and his politics, winning fans at home and far beyond. A crowd of supporters holding signs that read "Stand with Ilhan" and "Stop racism now" met her Thursday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport as she arrived from Washington. She was due to hold a town hall Thursday night in her Minneapolis district. Trump started the week’s tumult by tweeting Sunday that Omar and three other freshmen congresswomen could “go back” to their native countries if they were unhappy here. His other targets — all Trump detractors — were Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All are American citizens, and all but Omar was born in the U.S. She fled to America as a child with her family from violence-wracked Somalia. The president did not back down from that criticism on Thursday. They have "a big obligation and the obligation is to love your country," he said. "There's such hatred. They have such hatred." Citing Trump's rhetoric, House Democrats said they were discussing arranging security for Omar and the three other congresswomen. The Democratic-led House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's tweets as racist. On Wednesday, it rejected a resolution by one Democrat to impeach Trump that was opposed by party leaders as premature. The chants at the Trump rally brought scathing criticism from GOP lawmakers as well as from Democrats, though the Republicans did not fault Trump himself. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California declared that the chant has "no place in our party and no place in this country." Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted that it was "ugly, wrong, & would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers. This ugliness must end, or we risk our great union." Even by Trump's standards, the campaign rally offered an extraordinary tableau for American politics: a president drinking in a crowd's cries to expel a congresswoman from the country who's his critic and a woman of color. It was also the latest demonstration of how Trump's verbal cannonades are capable of dominating the news. Democrats had hoped the spotlight on Thursday would be on House passage of legislation to boost the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. To many GOP ears, this time the attention wasn't all positive. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, a conservative who attended Trump's rally, told reporters at the Capitol that the chant "does not need to be our campaign call like we did 'Lock her up' last time." That was a reference to a 2016 campaign mantra that Trump continues to encourage aimed at that year's Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Walker, who called the chant "offensive," was among about 10 House GOP leaders who had breakfast Thursday with Vice President Mike Pence at Pence's residence in Washington. Walker said he cautioned Pence that attention to the chant could distract voters next year from the economy and other themes Republicans want to emphasize. "We don't need to take it that far where we change the narrative of the story," he said he told Pence. The lawmakers attending agreed that the chant was inappropriate and could prove a harmful distraction, and Pence concurred and said he'd discuss it with Trump, said another participant who described the conversation on condition of anonymity. In North Carolina, Trump berated each of the four congresswomen and said: "They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, 'Hey if you don't like it, let 'em leave, let 'em leave.'" He added, "I think in some cases they hate our country." His criticism of Omar included a false accusation that she has voiced pride in al-Qaida. Among the Democrats criticizing Trump and his rally, 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden said Trump was exploiting race relations to excite his base and should have quieted the crowd. "Let me hear you say 'I condemn them,'" the former vice president said of Trump following a campaign event in Los Angeles. Underscoring the rocky period, House chaplain Pat Conroy's opening prayer Thursday began, "This has been a difficult and contentious week in which darker spirits seem to have been at play in the people's house. In your most holy name, I now cast out the spirit of darkness from this chamber." ___ Associated Press writers Padmananda Rama, Kathleen Hennessey, Zeke Miller, Deb Riechmann and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. 


WASHINGTON (AP) — The heat goes on: Earth sizzled to its hottest June on record as the climate keeps going to extremes.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Thursday announced that June averaged 60.6 degrees (15.9 Celsius), about 1.7 degrees (0.9 Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average.It beat out 2016 for the hottest June with records going back to 1880. NASA and other groups also concluded that last month was the hottest June on record.Europe shattered June temperature records by far, while other records were set in Russia, Africa, Asia and South America. France had its hottest month in history, which is unusual because July is traditionally hotter than June. The Lower 48 states in America were near normal.“Earth is running a fever that won’t break thanks to climate change,” North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello said in an email. “This won’t be the last record warm summer month that we will see.”It seems likely that July too will be a record hot month, said Berkeley Earth climate scientist Robert Rohde.The United States set a record for most precipitation. The 12-month period from July 2018 to June 2019 was the wettest on record.The first half of 2019 is tied with 2017 for the second hottest initial six months of the year, behind 2016. So far the year is 1.7 degrees warmer than the 20th century average.This heat “is what we can expect to see with a warming climate,” said Freja Vamborg, a climate scientist at the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

July 18, 20196:39 PM EDTVANCOUVER — A B.C. Human Rights Tribunal hearing devolved into repeated outbursts and name-calling this week as it considered a transgender woman’s complaint that a home-based salon discriminated against her by denying her a Brazilian wax.At one point, the complainant compared the business owner to a neo-Nazi. The lawyer for the business owner accused the complainant of engaging in “half-truths and fabrications.” Tribunal adjudicator Devyn Cousineau frequently had to interject to maintain decorum and to keep the hearing from careening off course.But a substantive question remained at the core of the raucous daylong hearing: should a business be allowed to deny service on the basis of gender identity?Jessica Yaniv, the complainant, told the hearing she was entitled to receive the advertised wax service and that if the tribunal ruled against her it could lead to a “dangerous” precedent.“You cannot choose who your clientele is going to be,” she said.I have no problem with LGBTHowever, business owner Marcia Da Silva said she was not comfortable carrying out a Brazilian wax on a person with male genitalia, nor did she have the training for it. Jay Cameron, Da Silva’s lawyer and litigation manager with the Alberta-based Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, told the hearing that a ruling against his client would be tantamount to ordering “intimate services” against someone’s will.The complaint heard Wednesday is one of more than a dozen filed by Yaniv, who describes herself as a digital marketing expert and LGBTQ activist. All allege she was the subject of discrimination by salons. A few complaints have been settled without hearing or withdrawn.Yaniv also made headlines recently for engaging in a social media spat with free-speech advocate Lindsay Shepherd, in which they both made disparaging remarks about each other. Twitter subsequently banned Shepherd from the platform, but not Yaniv.The tribunal had initially issued a publication ban shielding Yaniv’s identity, but on Wednesday Cousineau decided to lift the ban based on Yaniv’s social media presence and public advocacy.At Wednesday’s hearing, Yaniv, who is representing herself, said she came upon a Facebook ad in spring 2018 offering a promotion for a Brazilian wax, which involves the removal of pubic hair around the groin.Da Silva testified she had just started her home-based business after previously performing waxes on family and friends. Yaniv was the first person to respond to her ad, she said.They agreed over text message to an afternoon appointment. But Yaniv testified that after identifying herself as transgender and sending Da Silva a selfie, Da Silva cancelled the session.Da Silva told the tribunal, “I have no problem with LGBT.” She said she was just not comfortable waxing male genitals. The idea also did not sit well with her husband, she said. Further, she didn’t have any experience doing it.Everyone has the right to decide who comes in to their home, she added, noting that she was also uncomfortable with the persistent messages she was getting from Yaniv.“For my safety, I said, ‘No,’” she testified.Da Silva told the tribunal she defined someone who is transgender as a person who has undergone sex-reassignment surgery. She responded affirmatively when asked if she’d perform the waxing service on someone who had undergone such surgery.Yaniv said the advertisement Da Silva posted was open to the public and didn’t come with any conditions. She said that Da Silva should have accepted that Yaniv identifies as female rather than make assumptions about her based on appearance.“Your gender identity is your own,” Yaniv testified. “We live in a different day and age now.”We live in a different day and age nowAt one point, Yaniv equated the denial of service to neo-Nazism.Under cross-examination, Cameron put to Yaniv that Brazilian waxes were services performed only around female genitalia and that what Yaniv should have sought was a “brozilian” — waxes that involve male genitalia.That prompted Yaniv to tell the tribunal that she was intersex and that she had female body parts.“It exists,” she said, declining to elaborate.Cameron accused her of an outright “fabrication.”“You’re attempting to mislead the tribunal,” he said.Cameron called Yaniv’s credibility into question and earlier suggested that Yaniv had used a fake Facebook profile of a pregnant woman when she initially sought out the waxing service, a claim Yaniv denied.The tribunal heard that Da Silva shut down her salon business after her encounter with Yaniv.Earlier this month the JCCF also represented two other aestheticians who were the subject of similar complaints from Yaniv. One of them, a Sikh woman, said she declined to provide the waxing service for religious and safety reasons, according to a column posted by John Carpay, the centre’s president, on the website The Post Millennial.Businesses shouldn’t be allowed to use religion and culture to refuse service, Yaniv said.The justice centre obtained an expert who operates a men-only salon, Carpay wrote. That expert testified male clients will often get aroused when receiving waxing services. Also, the ideal wax for male genitals is different because the skin is very thin.Over the past year, the centre has made headlines for launching a legal challenge in Alberta against a law surrounding the formation of school clubs that are designed to support LGBTQ students (gay-straight alliances), specifically the section that prevents parents from being notified if their child joins one. In a speech Carpay also compared the rainbow pride flag to the swastika, comments for which he later apologized.Decisions on the various human rights complaints are not expected for weeks.• Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquanWe want to improve your reading experience27°CA few cloudsFeels like 36°CPostmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.

Between 1990 and 2015, EU countries reforested an area the size of PortugalON THE NORTHERN edge of Provence, a mountain pass winds its way out of a valley of apricot orchards and olive groves into a startling landscape of emerald forest and limestone ridges. This is part of one of France’s newest regional natural parks, the Baronnies Provençales, set up four years ago and spreading across 1,800 square kilometres (700 square miles) of the Drôme and Hautes-Alpes. With a mix of pine, oak and beech, fully 79% of the park is covered by forest, and this share is growing. In fact, as the world worries about deforestation, the total area of forests in France is actually on the rise.Forests now cover 31% of France. In terms of area, it is the fourth most forested country in the EU, after Sweden, Finland and Spain. Since 1990, thanks to better protection as well as to a decline in farming, France’s overall wooded or forested areas have increased by nearly 7%. And France is far from being alone. Across the EU, between 1990 and 2015, the total forested and wooded area grew by 90,000 square kilometres—an area roughly the size of Portugal. Almost every country has seen its forests grow over the period.Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.In the minds of city-dwellers and green voters, this is self-evidently a good thing. Certainly, the mass planting of trees on a global scale has the potential to help absorb the carbon-dioxide emissions that drive global warming. Deep within the Baronnies Provençales natural park, where rare species such as the black vulture can now occasionally be spotted above higher peaks, things are not quite that simple.Some of the 34,000 people who live inside the park see species such as the black pine, a drought-resistant conifer that encroaches on pastureland, as a pest. During the dry summer months, there are also worries that unmanaged forest growth increases the risk of fire. “The fact that forests are growing here can be problematic,” says Audrey Matt, in charge of forests at the park. “It all depends which way round you look at it.”Indeed, when the park was first created, local opposition groups were vocal. There were (unfounded) fears, recalls one local resident, that it would mean an end to hunting and would bring stricter environmental rules. An association calling itself “Free Baronnies, No Park” denounced a “steamroller” approach to its creation. It took nearly two decades of planning to set up the park and, even then, 44 of the 130 communes that lie within its boundaries initially refused to join in. A dozen or so have since changed their minds.Managing the forest is complex. The park covers a web of local governments. Most of the trees grow on private land, beyond the reach of rangers, and are therefore usually left untended. Competing demands, between those seeking to protect nature at all costs and others with jobs in logging or related industries, are not easy to reconcile. Paradoxically, France is a net importer of wood, something the French government wants to change. Yet last October employees of France’s National Forestry Office marched in the nearby town of Valence to protest against the increasing commercial exploitation of forests, as well as job and budget cuts.The French have a long and ambiguous link to their forests, a source of conflict during the revolution in the eighteenth century between nobles and peasants seeking firewood and land for grazing. The first serious attempt to protect them, a decree passed in 1669 under the ancien régime, was in reality designed to secure timber for Louis XIV’s naval ships. Then, as now, those with a long-term interest in exploiting forests have a powerful incentive to conserve and replenish them. ■Join them.

Change LocationNewscasts & VideosWATCH: Woman who fled China after working in a so-called vocational training centre for ethnic minorities speaks out
	                    
						
					
	                
					
				Sairagul Sauytbai, an ethnic Kazakh who fled China last year after working in a so-called vocational training centre for ethnic minorities, wanted to tell others about the beatings and torture she said she had seen there.But in neighbouring Kazakhstan, where she arrived to seek refuge, she was accused of crossing the border illegally, stripped naked, and told by state security agents to keep quiet about Beijing’s “de-radicalisation drive”, in which it has put hundreds of thousands of people in camps akin to prisons, Sauytbai and her lawyer told Reuters.

		The plight of Sairagul and others who have fled China‘s western Xinjiang region because of the camps highlights the difficulties they face in neighbouring countries that have close ties with Beijing, and explains why many remain silent about their experiences.Human rights groups say China has detained up to a million people in camps set up throughout Xinjiang, a region where Muslim Uighurs are the biggest ethnic group and where ethnic tensions have in the past resulted in violence.Former camp inmates have described them as prisons and told Reuters that people could be held there for months, being indoctrinated in Communist ideology. Beijing says the camps are “vocational training centres” designed to help prevent terrorism and extremism.WATCH: China shows off ‘education centres’ despite global concernSauytbai, 42, worked as a kindergarten principal in Xinjiang’s Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture when she was suddenly forcibly recruited in November 2017 to teach Chinese language and culture, as well as Communist Party doctrine, to inmates of a camp.Sauytbai’s husband and two children had already moved to Kazakhstan, but her passport had been confiscated, preventing her from joining them. When she got to the camp, she was appalled by the treatment of inmates, and saw beatings and torture.“I know many of them,” she said. “There are people ranging from ordinary shepherds to writers and social activists. There are people who have committed no crime.”Four months later, the authorities sent Sauytbai back home, where she was sacked from her kindergarten job. Fearing that she would soon be sent to a camp as an inmate, she sneaked into Kazakhstan illegally through Khorgos, a duty-free trade zone on the border.Sauytbai was soon detained in Kazakhstan and tried, but a court ruled against sending her back to China and gave her a suspended sentence.

		She then applied for asylum, but a state commission turned her down, saying it had not found sufficient evidence of persecution. Last month, she and her family left for Sweden, where she has applied for residence.Speaking to Reuters in the Swedish town of Trelleborg, Sauytbai said Kazakh security agents had warned her against criticising China.“After I came to Kazakhstan, having witnessed it all, I wanted to tell the whole world about it,” she said. “But the National Security Committee and my (former) lawyer Abzal Kuspan kept my mouth shut.”Kuspan confirmed he had advised her not to talk about the Chinese camps to avoid jeopardising her court case and her asylum request: “Our first concern was making sure she was not handed over to China.”

		He said he was aware that Sauytbai had come under pressure, especially immediately after her detention in Kazakhstan.“She was kept in some building, she was stripped naked,” he said.Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee did not reply to questions from Reuters about Sauytbai’s allegations. China‘s foreign ministry said that “the facts of Sairagul Sauytbai’s credit fraud and illegal border crossing crimes are clear and they must be punished severely”.Sauytbai’s family have told Kazakh media that they had an outstanding bank loan in China which they had planned to repay by selling their house – until she had to flee.The Chinese ministry also said that the “training centres strictly comply with the constitutional and legal principles and requirements for respecting and protecting human rights, and fully ensure that trainees’ human dignity is not infringed upon”. The Xinjiang government did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

		Xinjiang ethnic Kyrgyz market trader Aishan Memetrasul, 55, says he thought he had reached safety when he managed to get out of a camp by asking to see a badly ill relative.He crossed the border of neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, another central Asian republic, and applied to be naturalised on the basis of his Kyrgyz ethnicity – which local law allows.But the Kyrgyz authorities told him that he would need a document that he could only obtain in China. They sent him back, and he ended up back in the camp for another six weeks.He got out of the camp a second time on the pretext of going to Kyrgyzstan to fetch his elderly mother. Now in Kyrgyzstan, he has sought the government’s help to obtain the release of his numerous relatives who still live in Xinjiang.“The (Kyrgyz) government has not given us any answer,” Memetrasul told Reuters in an interview in Bishkek.Asked for comment on the camps, a Kyrgyz foreign ministry spokesman said it was keeping an eye on the matter and would use diplomatic channels to discuss any issues with Beijing.

Macho Belgian firefighters are furious at a Brussels-wide rebranding exercise that could ditch their tough badge, which boasts twin axes, helmet and flames, in favour of a heart-shaped flower. The new logo is consistent with Brussels in-house style and uses the city’s Iris motif, which is picked out with two stylised flames on one side. “The men think it is too soft,” said Dirk Van der Ougstraete, of the ACV trade union.Trade unionists said that the Brussels fire brigade was ready to mutiny against the new image, declared it looked more like a bottom than a badge and said it could lead to them being mistaken for postmen.  “Everyone is really furious. Our identity is completely lost with this,” said Eric Labourdette of the trade union VSOA. “If this comes through we will flex our muscles."He told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper: “Everywhere in the world there is an element in the fire department logo that really has to do with the fire department. Whether it is a flame, a helmet or an axe. This looks more like a backside than a fire department logo."Belgium is divided into three federal regions, including Brussels, which chose the Iris as its emblem in 1991. From 2012, the region has adopted a heart-shaped version of the flower for its in-house branding. “But we are a fire department. We do not have to advertise Brussels at all. We want flames, an axe and a helmet as an emblem,”  said Mr Labourdette. “They can put it on their envelopes and letters, but not on our uniforms or on our vehicles," he said, “With this logo, people might as well think that we are postmen.” “This has nothing to do with our profession and our traditions. It is very bad for our people,” he told the Het Laatste Nieuws newspaper.  “I already visited three stations today,” he added, “and they are very angry about everything.”A social media campaign using the hashtag #Touche pas à mon logo (hands off my logo) was launched after the design was leaked. Firefighters are incandescent that they were not consulted on their logo, which has sparked fears they will go on strike. "We actually discovered it by chance,” said Mr Labourdette. Brussels spokesman Walter Derieuw said that no final decision on the design had been taken. “The design that circulates is therefore not definitive. If a new logo is introduced, it will of course first be presented to the staff," he said. There were three recent protests over a new reward scheme, which unions felt was being forced on firemen by the Brussels regional government without proper consultation. In June, about 250 firefighters took to the streets of central Brussels, lighting fires and blocking traffic in a protest over remuneration. They set fire to boxes and tree stumps, sprayed foam and water and threw firecrackers as police looked on as they marched towards the Belgian prime minister’s office. Unions said that the firefighters monthly average wage was going down by about 300 euros in planned cuts and complained they were losing on call bonuses and other extras.   Iris flowers used to surround Brussels’ city walls and, according to legend, once gave the Duke of Brabant a famous military victory. The Duke’s cavalry, knowing the Iris would only grow in shallow water, were able to gallop through flooded plains by keeping to areas where the flowers were.© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

The man charged with the killing and rape of a prominent American scientist who was in Greece for a conference has been identified.Yiannis Paraskaki, 27, of Crete, was identified by Greek authorities on Thursday. Police say he confessed to the crimes after police questioning earlier in the week.Eaton, 59, a molecular biologist, was in Crete for a conference and is believed to have gone for a walk or jog around midday on July 2. She never returned.A massive search to find her was launched on Crete, Greece's largest island and a popular tourist destination, with search dogs, fire service rescuers, specialized sea equipment, and volunteers. Eaton's husband and two sons traveled to the island to help look for her, and family and friends raised tens of thousands of dollars to aid the search effort, which lasted six days.Her body was found on July 8 in the ventilation drain of an abandoned World War II bunker outside the port city of Chania, Crete.When Greek police brought in Paraskaki for questioning, he admitted to raping and murdering Eaton, saying he was "motivated by sexual satisfaction."He said he deliberately hit Eaton twice with his car, put her in his trunk, and abducted her. After assaulting and killing her, he dumped her body and tried to scrub his vehicle of evidence, authorities said.An autopsy showed the Eaton died from suffocation and had multiple broken bones in her ribs and face, and injuries to her hands.She worked at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, Germany, which described her as a leading scientist in her field and mourned her death in a statement. She was attending an conference at the the Orthodox Academy of Crete."Suzanne was an outstanding and inspiring scientist, a loving spouse and mother, an athlete as well as a truly wonderful person beloved to us all," the institute said. "Her loss is unbearable."Ben Kesslen writes for NBC News. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL

    President Trump says he "felt a little bit badly" about the chants of "send her back" that erupted at his North Carolina rally.
    USA TODAYWASHINGTON – Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in on the controversial"send her back" chant at President Donald Trump's Wednesday rally, calling it “hurtful, wrong and completely unacceptable.”According to the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail, Trudeau and European Union President Donald Tusk denounced the comments at a trade summit news conference on Thursday. “I want everyone in Canada to know that those comments are completely unacceptable and should not be allowed, encouraged in Canada,” said Trudeau. Earlier in the press conference, Tusk had quipped that he felt "at home" in Montreal, where he "didn't hear anyone shouting 'send him back.'"Reuters video shows Tusk saying, "sometimes if you feel that something is totally unacceptable you have to react, despite business, despite interest, for me, values are much more important than trade," Tusk said, “maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I will never change my opinion."The chant: Outrage, expressions of support for Rep. Ilhan Omar after 'send her back' chant at Trump rallyWhat we know: the 'send her back' chants that erupted at Trump's North Carolina rallyDuring Trump's Wednesday rally in North Carolina, after he denounced Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., the crowd started chanting "send her back," a reference to Trump's Sunday tweets about freshmen progressive lawmakers needing to "go back" to other countries. Omar came to the United States as a refugee and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. There were two instances during which the North Carolina crowd began chanting "send her back." The president did not stop the first time, and continued on with his speech. However, during a second round of the chants, Trump paused for several seconds as the chant grew louder.Trump disavows the chant: Donald Trump blames supporters for 'send her back' taunts against black lawmakerThe chant: 'Send her back' Trump rally chant heightens calls for increased security for Rep. OmarThe chants sparked a wave of condemnation and outrage from Democrats, and some criticism from congressional Republicans. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., called for Rep. Omar to have increased security in the event she received threats.  Trump later disavowed the chants and blamed the crowd for them, saying, "I didn't say that," referring to the chant. "They did."Contributing: Rebecca Morin.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comA man who served decades in prison for stabbing his wife 14 times in front of her daughter was convicted Wednesday in a nearly identical crime — stabbing a woman at least 11 times while her twin children watched.Albert Flick, 77, of Auburn, Maine who was previously deemed too old to be a threat by a judge, was convicted in the 2018 death of Kimberly Dobbie. Jurors deliberated less than an hour before reaching its guilty verdict.Both the attack, which was in front of a laundromat in broad daylight, and Flick's purchase two days earlier of two knives, were caught on surveillance video.

They knew one another, witnesses said, but were not in a relationship.Assistant Attorney General Bud Ellis told jurors in his closing argument that Flick knew Dobbie was going to be leaving town and thought to himself, "If I can't have her, I will kill her."Defense attorney Allan Lobozzo said there had been no indication his client posed a threat.The state's medical examiner testified that the wounds penetrated the victim's heart and lung.Caitlain Jasper, one of the three alternate jurors, told the Sun Journal that she felt sorry for Dobbie's 11-year-old children and for the three men who witnessed the attack and acted swiftly to stop it.FATAL STABBINGS OF MOM, 3 KIDS LEAVE RELATIVES, FRIENDS DEVASTATED; SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, AUTHORITIES SAY

The judge at the time ignored the recommendation of the prosecutor for a longer sentence, saying Flick would not be a threat because of his age and it didn't make sense to keep him incarcerated. He was released and moved to Lewiston in 2014.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

A migrant smuggler has been detained in Spain after allegedly beheading a passenger over a stolen juice drink during a recent journey that departed from Morocco.Oumar Diallo, from Guinea in West Africa, was transporting over a dozen people across the Alboran Sea at the time of the incident, which took place in early July according to the newspaper El Mundo. The outlet reported each person paid €2,500 for the trip across a stretch of 200 kilometers.It is alleged that Diallo reacted violently after a fatigued passenger drank his juice, taken from a survival pack. Spanish media reported that Diallo decapitated the victim with a dagger before throwing the head overboard. The body remained on the boat for another 45 minutes."He has cut off his head. He has gone crazy," a young passenger who was on the vessel at the time of the attack told a Red Cross volunteer upon their rescue, El Mundo reported.The migrants who survived were taken in by the Spanish Commission for Refugees (CEAR) and transported from Almeria to a shelter in Malaga, which is a coastal city in the Costa del Sol region. Diallo was held by local police as investigators worked to find out what happened.According to Il Giornale, some passengers who witnessed the atrocity have since had to receive psychological treatment. Some are suffering from anxiety attacks and an inability to sleep.Omar Naji, president of the Moroccan Human Rights Association, said that his organization was already aware of the man's record of trafficking humans, including vulnerable women.Naji said the suspect is known to convince people to travel to Morocco promising them a better future. When they arrive he requests up to €3,000 to take them to Spain by boat. Naji added: "We [flagged] him several times. Moroccan police detained him and set him free again."Local media reported police in Morocco recently arrested two of Diallo's partners who were in charge of obtaining boats used to transport people. They were reportedly a father and son. The victim in the beheading incident has not yet been identified by law enforcement. It remains unclear what type of boat was used.According to campaigners from aid group CEAR, there was a significant increase in asylum claims in Spain last year. It said the country's government has rejected three out of four asylum applications."Spain became the main country of entry to Europe with more than 65,383 irregular arrivals by sea and land, almost triple [of 2017]," it said in a blog. "Spain received 51% of maritime arrivals to the EU through the Mediterranean. Most boats reached the Andalusian coast. At least 811 people died trying to reach Spanish coasts, one third of all registered in the Mediterranean."© 2019 Newsweek


 German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned US President Donald Trump's racist comments about freshmen congresswomen, saying his stance "thwarts America's strength" as a diverse country.  In a  press conference Friday, Merkel discussed Trump's remarks, which began with a tweet on Sunday in which he  said four progressive congresswomen should "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came." All four congresswomen are US citizens, and three were born in the country  She said she distances herself from the comments "without question" and that she "stands in solidarity" with the congresswomen Trump "attacked."

You can see part of her response here:  Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau, UK Prime Minister  Theresa May, and New Zealand Prime Minister  Jacinda Ardern have also condemned Trump's comments, as have other  UK politicians and  Ireland's foreign minster, though none have used the word "racist."                                                                                                          Trump's attacks were  aimed at Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who are all progressive Democrats, women of color, and vocal critics of Trump.

Watch VICE News Tonight on HBO weekdays at 7:30.In D.C., Rep. Ilhan Omar faces near-constant attacks from President Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican Party. But back home in Minnesota, people are thrilled to see her.When Omar arrived at the Minneapolis airport on Thursday night, she was greeted by a large crowd cheering her on.“Welcome home, Ilhan!” the crowd chanted. “We have your back!” shouted a supporter. Minnesota Public Radio estimated more than 150 people showed up to greet Omar. It was a demonstration of solidarity for the Democratic lawmaker, who's had a particularly difficult week. In D.C., Rep.

READ: Trump rallies have a new racist chantThe progressive freshman representative, along with the rest of “The Squad” — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — has faced regular, racist attacks from the president and his allies this week.Last weekend, the president told the four women of color — all of whom are American citizens — to "go back" and help fix the “totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.” And he doubled down on the comment a few times, even after facing backlash. By Wednesday, the crowd at a Trump rally in North Carolina was targeting Omar, yelling “Send her back”. Omar came to the U.S. at age 12 as a refugee from Somalia.Even Republicans say they were disturbed by the chants, and the president eventually tried to distance himself from it, saying he disagreed with them — even though the chants were inspired by his own tweets.READ: Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are punching back at Trump's "fascist rhetoric"Omar, meanwhile, seemed unfazed.“The reality is everybody talks about how [Trump] is threatened because we criticize him,” Omar told a crowd at the airport, according to MPR. “But the reality is he is threatened because we are inspiring people to dream about a country that recognizes our dignity and our humanity.”Omar, who returned home to participate in a town hall on Medicare for All, told the crowd she would not be distracted from getting work done, and she promised Trump wouldn't get in her way."We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president because his policies are a nightmare to us," she told the crowd, according to NPR. “We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready."

 House Democrats are demanding extra security for Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar after President Donald Trump's supporters  repeatedly chanted "send her back" on a Wednesday rally, where Trump smeared her as a terrorist sympathizer.  Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee,  wrote to the Capitol Police Board on Thursday: "Since last night's Trump campaign rally, the hashtag #SendHerBack is trending on Twitter with tweets referring to Rep. Omar as a terrorist sympathizer and calls for her deportation despite being a US citizen."  "The President's attacks on Members of Congress have emboldened people to pursue acts of violence towards public officials," he added  Thompson  on Monday had already asked Capitol Police to convene an emergency meeting to review their security procedures in light of Trump's attacks on four progressive Democrats — Reps. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts — earlier this week.  Trump on Thursday said he "was not happy" with the "send her back" shouts, but he did not appear to show it, as he stood and looked around for several seconds as the chants went on.  Other Democratic lawmakers have said that the president's words have placed Omar and her family in danger.                                                                                                                      Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus,  told Politico on Thursday: "It's crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger."  "He has threatened the safety of a member of Congress," he added, referring to Trump. "That takes this to a whole different level."  Texas Rep. Al Green announced on the House floor Thursday that he plans to bring a bill that would provide more security for legislators.                                                                                                                      Only congressional leaders receive enhanced security details under current rules.> "This is an important time in this country. These are dangerous times. Every member of this House needs additional security," Green said,  as quoted by The Hill. "Leadership has adequate security. Members do not have adequate security. I want to thwart the efforts of those who might want to harm a member of this House," he added.  Omar told reporters Thursday that she wasn't worried for her own security, but was concerned for the security of others who might be in danger because of Trump's attacks.  "When you have a president who clearly thinks someone like me should go back, the message that he's sending is not for me, it's to every single person who shares an identity with me," she said.                                                                                                                      She then  accused Trump of being a "fascist."Read more: Rep. Ilhan Omar greeted with new chant upon arrival in Minnesota: 'Welcome home Ilhan' In his Monday letter, Thompson listed a number of recent threats and violent plots against Omar.                                                                                                                      They included the  April arrest of a Trump supporter in New York for insulting and threatening to kill Omar because of her Muslim faith.  That month, she said that a video tweeted by Trump with edited comments of remarks she gave about 9/11 and the foundation of the Council on American-Islamic Relations had caused a new wave of death threats against her. 


On July 2, at 9:02 a.m., Stockton University professor Elisa von Joeden-Forgey, a Bella Vista resident, received a text from her friend Elly: “Elisa ICE detain me n my husband.” “It’s a text nobody wants to get,” Forgey wrote on Facebook later that day, after spending the day at the Philadelphia ICE office trying to get information about Elly and her husband, Fnu. Forgey detailed the frustrating experience in a Facebook post titled “American Nightmare,” that, as of press time, has been shared more than 21,000 times. Here, an adapted version of that Facebook post, edited lightly for length and clarity: My friends Elly and Fnu are asylum seekers from Indonesia who have been in this country for about 20 years as their case wound its way through the immigration system. They have two children who are American citizens. They are beloved members of the community, people who volunteer for everything. As with many asylum cases, their case has sometimes left them “out of status.” This is how their arrest was justified.When I heard that they had been detained, I did not know what to do, so I went to the Philadelphia ICE office. It is a nondescript three-floor operation at 114 North 8th Street. It is sparse, with portable metal detectors and a few chairs, line separators that lead nowhere, and framed photos of President Trump and Vice President Pence hanging askew on the wall.The security personnel on the first floor don’t make eye contact. They asked me why I was there. I said because my friends had been picked up earlier that morning. “Are you sure?” they asked. I wondered if they did this to create confusion and persuade me to leave. I said I was sure. They asked me for my friend’s name and I gave it to them. To me, it seemed like they recognized Elly’s name when I said it.“Put your things here,” they said. “Walk through there,” they said, ushering my through the metal detector.“Thank you,” I found myself saying, as if they had just done me a favor. I asked myself why I was doing this. Perhaps because they seem to have knowledge? Can they maybe help my friend? Or impart some secret information that will spring my friends from the grips of state power?“You can go to the third floor,” they said. “You can ask about your friends there.”The office on the third floor was cramped. Chairs along walls. A standing table for filling out paperwork. Lots of people from many places. Children with toys. I was initially confused by sounds of joy. A father laughed as his toddler played with a plastic tic-tac-toe board. For a short moment I relaxed, my body thinking I was in a pediatrician’s office.I looked for my friend’s brother, who I knew was on the way. He was not there.There was a small plexiglass window with one of those metal speakers. Behind it were three people doing something that I can only describe as milling about. There was nothing in their “office.” Not even a chair. No calendar. There was none of the collegiality you see in real offices.I went to the plexiglass. “Hello?” I said into the speaker. Three people ignored me. I stood and waited. Could they not hear me? I bent down to speak again and a woman on the other side looked at me and said, “Press the button,” motioning to something on my left. She watched me as I found the button and pressed it. I heard no sound.She squared her shoulders. “Can I help you?”“I’m here about a friend of mine who was picked up this morning.”“Yes?” She replied.“I would like to register community support. She and her husband are very important members of our community.”“We don’t do that here.”“Her name is. ...”“We don’t do that here. We have nothing to write it down on.”“Well, can I write it down and maybe you can put it in her file or tell someone?”“We don’t do that.”I stood back, thinking about next steps. There’s almost no signage in the room, but I noticed a photocopy taped to the plexiglass: “Please, please, please ring the bell.” I turned around, baffled.Just then, my husband, Scott, walked in. I felt a renewed sense of hope.We approached the plexiglass together.He spoke through the metal microphone and, before I could tell him, he was told by a man on the inside to ring the bell.With the bell pressed, Scott told the man that he was there to support two important community members who were picked up this morning on their way to work.“Okay,” the man said. “What do you want?”“I’d like to see them.”“You can’t do that.”“Why not?”“Because you can’t.”“I’d like to talk to the agent who arrested them.”“If you are not a lawyer. ...”“I am a lawyer.” He presented his business card.“Sit down over there.”We sat. I noticed a woman standing with the family whose toddler had earlier been making his father laugh. She walked over to the plexiglass window.“Excuse me,” she said.No answer. People walking around on the inside. She rested her weight on her elbow and scanned the waiting room with authority. She turned back to peer into the inside. Her left hand pressed the bell with annoyance. “EXCUSE ME.” Pressed, pressed, pressed the bell.She scanned the waiting room again. She caught my eye and I realized I was smiling with relief at her acknowledgment of this strange situation. I felt shame for smiling, but she seemed pleased.“You know they do this because they can,” she announced to me loudly.Pressed, pressed, pressed the bell. Finally, a woman on the other side made some gesture of recognition.“A LADY I AM HELPING CANNOT READ AND FILLED OUT HER FORM ALL WRONG AND I NEED ANOTHER BLANK COPY. CAN I PLEASE JUST GET ONE?”A blank form was slid through an opening where the plexiglass meets the wall.She took it and walked over to me.“They don’t provide anyone for the illiterate people who come here,” she said loudly. “It’s a scandal. It’s disgusting. What are all these people supposed to do? I don’t care what is going on,” she said almost as an afterthought. “But you treat people with respect. That’s just how it works!”She returned to the family she was helping.As we waited, I realized that somewhere behind the walls in front of me are my friends. Their phones have been taken. Are they together? Have they eaten? What must they be feeling? In panic, I began to cry.Then, a blond, blue-eyed man in a baseball cap, an untucked shirt, and jeans appeared behind the plexiglass and peered out with small, blank eyes. He looked like he could be at a ballpark or firing up the grill for a barbecue.Scott jumped up. “I’m here to see my friends who are being detained in this building.”“You can’t do that.”“Why not?”“If you are not a lawyer. ...”“I am a lawyer.” Scott showed his card again.“If you are not their lawyer. ...”“Okay, I’m their lawyer. Who are you?”“I don’t have to tell you that.”“I’d like to speak to the agent who arrested them. Is that you?”The man hesitated, then said yes. He motioned for Scott to come to the side. They disappeared down a hallway.I texted Elly’s brother. I was hoping Scott would soon see her and Fnu.Quickly, Scott returned. He could not see our friends without filling out a form that they do not keep at this office. The agent told him that they would be moved to a detention center by 3 p.m. It was already after 12.We sat for a bit, but soon realized that we were sitting there with no goal and no hope.As we left, the security guards were milling about downstairs. I thanked them again, this time with a sense of despair. “No problem,” they said.We met with Elly’s brother in his car to plan next steps. He’d found a lawyer to take their case. His phone was ringing almost nonstop as he coordinated details. My friends’ college-aged daughter was very quiet in the passenger seat. She had taken the day off from her work-study job after seeing her parents driven away in separate unmarked ICE vehicles.Elisa von Joeden-Forgey is the Dr. Marsha Raticoff Grossman Associate Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Stockton University. A few days after her Facebook post went viral, she learned that her friends were taken to separate detention facilities. Their fate at this time is still unknown.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Democrat Mike Broihier, a political newcomer with a broad resume as a Marine officer, farmer and small-town newspaperman, ventured into a high-stakes Senate race as the latest military-tested candidate aiming to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell next year in Kentucky.Broihier acknowledged Thursday that his campaign starts with a virtual blank slate, needing to build name recognition and a campaign fund to compete with an establishment-backed rival in his own party. Former fighter pilot Amy McGrath entered the race last week to a rocky start while showing immediate fundraising prowess. Both Democrats rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.Broihier set his sights on McConnell in his campaign announcement video, saying the Republican leader “refined the art of obstruction” and “weaponized the filibuster to his own political purposes. And when it doesn’t fit, he throws the rules and 200 years of tradition onto the ash heap of history — democracy be damned.”He blasted McConnell for his self-anointed role as the Grim Reaper killing the priorities of House Democrats.“While this may have served his political interest, it hasn’t served ours,” Broihier said in his online video launch. “It’s time to retire Mitch McConnell and restore democracy.”The first-time candidate offered a message of unity across racial and urban-rural lines while accusing the six-term incumbent of using “labels to reinforce old prejudices, to divide us, to maintain his grip on power.”“This campaign is going to be a long, hard fight but it is a worthy cause because it is a fight for the soul of Kentucky,” the former artillery officer said. “And it starts now.”Kentucky’s 2020 primary isn’t until next spring, but Broihier will need to be a quick study as a politician. He retired from the Marines in 2005 after a 21-year career that included assignments in Somalia, Japan and the Korean peninsula. He and his wife, Lynn, also a retired Marine officer, bought a farm near Stanford, Kentucky, where they’ve raised cattle, goats and sheep and grow asparagus sold at restaurants, food co-ops and farmers’ markets.Broihier, 57, began a five-year stint with his local weekly newspaper, The Interior Journal, in 2007 and became editor two years later.“I came to Kentucky to farm,” he said in an interview. “I didn’t come here to run for political office. It’s just been this growing frustration over the years that I finally said, ‘Well, it’s time to do something.’”Broihier staked out positions opposed to some of President Donald Trump’s top priorities. Trump carried Kentucky by a landslide in 2016 and remains a commanding presence in Kentucky politics. McConnell has closely attached himself to the Republican president in seeking another term.Broihier said in an interview that he would have voted against the massive, GOP-backed package of individual and corporate tax cuts that became Trump’s marquee legislative achievement.“Mitch McConnell’s contributors have gotten richer,” he said. “But no one I know has gotten richer because of those tax cuts.”As for Trump’s immigration policies, he denounced the detention facilities holding migrants near the nation’s southern border as “horrific and un-American” and said the president’s use of tariffs in disputes with key trading partners has hurt American companies, farmers and consumers.Broihier said he would have opposed Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell has worked closely with Trump in winning Senate approval for a wave of conservative judges, including Kavanaugh, for seats on the federal bench.Jumping into the political battle over abortion rights, Broihier said: “If I am elected, I will not vote for a federal judge who just doesn’t accept the fact that the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade correctly.”It was a question about Kavanaugh that tripped up McGrath soon after she entered the Senate race.McGrath, who narrowly lost a Kentucky congressional race last year, initially told the Courier Journal she would have voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the high court but changed her mind hours later. It put a damper on a highly publicized rollout that netted McGrath more than $2.5 million in campaign funds within 24 hours of announcing her run.“It started with a big splash of money and then (she) kind of stepped in it,” Broihier said of his fellow Marine.Broihier portrayed McGrath as the favorite of Democratic insiders in Washington, but said that won’t matter to voters in Kentucky.“People in D.C. are keeping track of how much money she’s raising,” he said. “I don’t think that means a hill of beans to the voters in Kentucky.”


AdvertisementClose XOlivier Douliery/ZUMALess than a day after attempting to disavow the “send her back” chants that erupted at his North Carolina rally, President Donald Trump on Friday returned to targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar, once again accusing the Minnesota congresswomen of hating the United States.The newest attack made it clear that despite claiming to distance himself from the racist refrain, Trump is set to continue smearing the four Democratic congresswomen of color—Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib—he has repeatedly demanded “go back” to their “crime-infested” countries this week.The president’s commitment to pummeling the congresswomen had been immediately apparent even in Trump’s so-called disavowal on Thursday when he claimed that he “was not happy” with the chant and that he had stopped his supporters from chanting it “very quickly.” (Videos of the rally show Trump embracing the chant and waiting more than ten seconds to continue with his prepared remarks.)Trump on Friday also hit back at Democrats who have condemned his ongoing racist attacks, framing their outrage as both unhinged and unfair.It is amazing how the Fake News Media became “crazed” over the chant “send her back” by a packed Arena (a record) crowd in the Great State of North Carolina, but is totally calm & accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by the three Radical Left Congresswomen…— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019In lashing out at Omar, Trump also felt compelled to compare the crowd size of Wednesday’s rally in Greenville, North Carolina to the size of the group of supporters that welcomed Omar as she returned to Minnesota Thursday night. “Welcome home, Ilhan!” the crowd cheered as she arrived at the airport.….State which I will win in #2020 because they can’t stand her and her hatred of our Country, and they appreciate all that I have done for them (opening up mining and MUCH more) which has led to the best employment & economic year in Minnesota’s long and beautiful history!— Donald J.

On Thursday, President Trump attempted to distance himself from the racist chant of “send her back” about Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar at a Trump campaign rally Wednesday in North Carolina. The chants rang across the rally in response to Trump’s own verbal attack against the congresswoman. He did nothing to intervene. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks against Congressmembers Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We speak with Ibram X. Kendi, founding director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University.Please check back later for full transcript.

				Supporters of President Donald Trump cheer as he speaks during a Keep America Great rally on July 17, 2019 in Greenville, North Carolina.			
				Zach Gibson/Getty Images			President Trump’s supporters broke into a “Send Her Back!” chant directed at Ilhan Omar during his rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday night — and guess what? Republicans are very concerned.So troubled were some members of the party’s leadership in the House of Representatives, Politico reported on Thursday, that they convened with Vice President Mike Pence over breakfast to express their discomfort, urging him to relay their concerns to the president. He must have gotten the message, as Trump told reporters at the White House that he actually was “not happy” and “disagrees” with the racist chant his racist tweets and comments inspired Wednesday night, and which he did absolutely nothing to stop, instead pausing for nearly 15 seconds to allow the chant to be better heard.	Here’s a sampling of what the distressed House Republicans have said about the chant:Though it was brief, I struggled with the “send her back” chant tonight referencing Rep. Omar.  Her history, words & actions reveal her great disdain for both America & Israel. That should be our focus and not phrasing that’s painful to our friends in the minority communities.— Rep. Mark Walker (@RepMarkWalker) July 18, 2019I deeply disagree with the extreme left & have been disgusted by their tone. I woke up today equally disgusted – chants like “send her back” are ugly, wrong, & would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers. This ugliness must end, or we risk our great union.— Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) July 18, 2019On Tuesday, everyone one of these moralizing lawmakers had an opportunity to vote for a House resolution to condemn Trump’s racist attacks against Omar and the three other congresswomen of color the president told to “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came” before they criticize his administration.They all declined to do so.	In total, only 4 of 197 House Republicans supported the resolution. Among those who opposed it was Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH), who on Monday tweeted that Trump’s comments “were racist” while calling for the president to apologize. “We must work as a country to rise above hate, not enable it,” Turner wrote.What a difference a day makes.When reached for comment, Rep. Turner said only that the “resolution on the floor was a political stunt by Nancy Pelosi that I do not support.”Emails to the press offices of Reps. Walker, Mitchell, and Emmer seeking clarity on how they reconcile their disgust over the “Send Her Home!” chant with their defense of Trump’s tweets did not receive immediate replies. Rep. McCarthy said in a statement provided to Rolling Stone that though the chants “have no place in our party or our country,” the president’s tweets were “referring to the love of this country, and said if you don’t love this country you can leave.”  A representative for Rep. Kinzinger provided a statement explaining why he voted against the House resolution on Tuesday, his rationale hinging on an objection to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi breaking “the very rules of the institution she leads” by calling the president’s comments “racist.” This linguistic infraction on the House floor somehow played a larger role in determining his vote than the president’s comments, which he also disparaged. “I have said time and again that I strongly disagree with the President on tone and his use of Twitter, and I believe his tweet this weekend was wrong and dangerously divisive,” he wrote.“Simply put, we can and must do better,” Kinzinger concluded. He was referencing Pelosi’s indiscretion, not the president.This post has been updated.

Imagine that you live in a town that has been taken over by gangsters. The mayor is a crook and so are the district attorney and police chief. You can’t fight city hall. But at least you know you can turn for help to the state or federal government. Now imagine that it’s not a city or state that has been taken over by criminals — it’s the federal government. Where do you turn for help? That is not a theoretical concern. After the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report, it’s our grim reality. Even before Mueller’s probe ended, federal prosecutors in New York had implicated President Trump in ordering his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to violate federal campaign finance laws. Mueller then documented at least six ironclad incidents of obstruction of justice by Trump along with numerous instances of misconduct that, while not criminal, are definitely impeachable. The New York Review of Books reported that two prosecutors working for Mueller said that if Trump weren’t president, he would have been indicted.Now the administration is obstructing attempts to bring the president to justice for obstruction of justice. William P. Barr isn’t the attorney general; he is, as David Rothkopf said, the obstructor general. We now know that Mueller wrote (in Barr’s description) a “snitty” letter objecting that Barr’s deceptive summary of his work, designed to falsely exonerate Trump, “threatens to undermine … public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”Yet when Barr testified to Congress after receiving the Mueller letter but before releasing the Mueller report, he claimed not to know whether Mueller disagreed with his conclusions. “He lied to Congress,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) charged. But even if it could be proved that Barr committed perjury (no sure thing), who would prosecute him? Is he (or his deputy) going to appoint a special counsel to investigate himself? Unlikely. And if he did appoint a special counsel, would he heed the counsel’s conclusions? Also unlikely.Barr’s jaw-dropping performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday dispelled any lingering confidence in the impartial administration of justice — the bedrock of our republic. He actually testified that if the president feels an investigation is unfounded, he “does not have to sit there constitutionally and allow it to run its course. The president could terminate the proceeding and it would not be a corrupt intent because he was being falsely accused.” Given that no president has ever felt justly accused of any misconduct, this means that the president is above the law. Barr is endorsing the Nixon doctrine: “Well, when the president does it, that means it’s not illegal.”The administration makes clear that this is precisely its intent with its scandalous stonewalling of Congress. Barr himself refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Trump is suing to prevent his accountants and financial institutions from sharing his business records with Congress, while his treasury secretary is refusing to comply with a lawful demand for his tax returns. Trump is also blocking numerous current and former officials, including former White House counsel Donald McGahn, from testifying about his misdeeds. His conduct is redolent of the third article of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon for failing “to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas” from Congress.While conferring legal immunity upon himself, Trump is eager to weaponize the legal system against his opponents. The Mueller report documents three separate occasions when Trump demanded a Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now, the New York Times reports, Trump and his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, are attempting to instigate a criminal probe of his leading 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, on what appear to be trumped-up charges of corruption. In one of the more chilling exchanges during his Senate testimony, Barr would not say whether “the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested” that he open an investigation. If the answer were “no,” he would have said so.It is hard to think of any president in the past 230 years, including Nixon, who has ever sabotaged the rule of law so flagrantly or so successfully to protect his own hide. And, sadly, it is hard to imagine that anything can be done about it before Nov. 3, 2020. The House could try to compel compliance with its subpoenas, but the Justice Department will never file criminal charges, and the courts could take years to decide a civil suit. The House could vote to impeach Trump or Barr — which they richly deserve — but that would be a purely symbolic act and could backfire politically because Senate Republicans, like the O.J. Simpson jury, would vote to acquit regardless of the evidence.So for the next 18 months, at a minimum, this nation is at the mercy of a criminal administration. I am in despair as I have never been before about the future of our experiment in self-rule. Before Mueller filed his report, it was possible to imagine the president being brought to justice. That fantasy is no longer tenable. Instead we are left with the dismaying likelihood that the president will now feel emboldened to commit ever greater transgressions to hold onto power — and thus delay a possible post-presidential indictment.Read more:Greg Sargent: The White House’s latest attack on Mueller reveals an ugly truth about TrumpEugene Robinson: The American people need to hear from Mueller — directlyRandall D.

 Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  President Trump’s tweet proposing that four Democratic congresswomen of color — three of them born in the United States, one a naturalized citizen — “go back” to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came” was textbook racism. Yet while some Republicans condemned the statement — Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), who is black, lamented its “racially offensive language” — others flatly denied that there was a racial component to the salvo. A particularly contorted reaction came from Rep. Andy Harris (Md.), who said, “Clearly, it’s not a racist comment,” adding that the president “could have meant go back to the district they came from, to the neighborhood they came from.” But the president could hardly have made his meaning more clear: He said the four “originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.”  “Well, I certainly do not think the president’s a racist,” said Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who suggested that the tweet was justified by the representatives’ constant criticism “not only [of] the president but also Congress and our country.”Fear of crossing a president who’s popular with the Republican base surely explains some of the convoluted rationalizations on offer. But a psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance may also shed light on some people’s unwillingness to acknowledge the self-evident racism in the tweets. Cognitive dissonance, first described by the psychologist Leon Festinger in the late 1950s, occurs when conflict emerges between what people want to believe and the reality that threatens those beliefs. The human mind does not like such inconsistencies: They set off alarms that spur the mind to alter some beliefs to make the perceived reality fit with one’s preferred views. In the case of Trump’s remarks — when absorbed by his supporters who do not consider themselves racist — those inconsistencies can be summarized in a sort of syllogism: (1) I do not support racists. (2) I do support President Trump. (3) President Trump has just made a racist remark. Those three facts simply don’t fit together comfortably in the mind.  Just as a hungry person will seek food to alleviate hunger, Festinger argued, people who experience mental discrepancies of this sort will work to put them in accord, to reduce the dissonance. And they will often go to extraordinary lengths to do so: Resolving cognitive dissonance often takes considerable mental gymnastics. Supporters of Trump who experience cognitive dissonance over his remarks essentially have three psychological options to resolve it, altering in various ways the three beliefs that are in tension. One is to change the belief that they do not support racists. This response is unlikely, however, because it would require a massive overhaul of the view of the self, placing the person in a category he or she knows is morally dubious, not to mention socially vilified. Very rare is the person who will resolve psychological dissonance by saying, “Actually, I am a monster.” [Why does President Trump keep dragging Jews into his attacks?]Another option is to introduce new beliefs that bolster support for Trump. This does not address the conflicts among beliefs head-on but rather lessens the impact of the inflammatory statement by considering positive information about the president. One approach along these lines is to emphasize the awfulness of the policy positions and statements of the congresswomen Trump attacked, thereby casting the president as a defender of decency (and perhaps as a victim himself, not an aggressor). Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), for instance, described Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) as “a bunch of communists” who “hate Israel” and “hate our own country.” Relatedly, Marc Short, Vice President Pence’s chief of staff, played up Trump’s lack of racism in other contexts, noting that his transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, was born in Taiwan. As reasons for supporting the president grow — either his sterling qualities or the negative characteristics of his opponents — it becomes easier to overlook a single misstep. A third route to resolving dissonance, in this specific case, is to flatly (and boldly) reject the consensus that telling someone to “go back” to their family’s country of origin is racist. Rep. Harris — with his revisionist argument that Trump wanted the women to go back to their districts — is probably the most striking example of this. But Fox News analyst Brit Hume may also belong in this category, with his hairsplitting statement that Trump’s comments were “nativist, xenophobic . . . and politically stupid” — but absolutely not racist, “a word so recklessly flung around these days that its actual meaning is being lost.” If Trump is just the latest in a long parade of people falsely accused of racism by liberals, that, too, makes it easier to take his side. (“Xenophobic” is not too far from “racist,” definitionally, but it does not carry nearly the same moral charge, so reframing the accusation that way may well ease psychological tension.) Since the uproar, Trump has proclaimed that many people agree with his controversial statement and that indeed, “a lot of people love it.” But decades of behavioral research suggests that not all the people refraining from condemning the president support his attacks. Instead, they’re doing mental contortions to explain away the ugliness, to justify their continued support of him — and to maintain their positive views of themselves. Read more from Outlook:Trump’s ‘Migrant Protection Protocols’ hurt the people they’re supposed to helpWhy does President Trump keep dragging Jews into his attacks?Joe Walsh: Trump’s racist tweeting should be the GOP’s last straw.

"There's a racial division in this country that's being instigated by the president and we here at ESPN haven't had the stomach for that fight because Jemele [Hill] did some things on Twitter, and you saw what happened after that and then here, all of a sudden, nobody talks politics on anything unless they use one of these sports figures as a meat shield in the most cowardly possible way to discuss these subjects." "We don't talk about what is happening unless there's some sort of weak, cowardly sports angle that we can run it through when sports has always been the place where this stuff changes," Le Batard added.Stop what you're doing and watch this.@LeBatardShow responds to the racist "Send her back" and "Go back to your country" attacks against Ilhan Omar and other congresswomen."If you're not calling it abhorrent, obviously racist, dangerous rhetoric, you're complicit." pic.twitter.com/ntOC2Seg3b"Man, Muhammad Ali was fighting for this stuff in the '60s!

You're more privileged, you're whiter, you're richer, people don't know whether your money is real or not,” Le Batard said. “You've had every privilege afforded to you, every privilege! And now, what you do with that power? You go after brown people and black people and minorities? And around here, we won't talk about it? We won't talk about it unless Russell Wilson is saying something about it on his Instagram.” Trump has been facing heat from both Republicans and Democrats for the the “send her back” chant.Trump, who was already under fire over weekend tweets telling Omar and three other congresswomen of color to “go back” to their home countries, sought to distance himself from the controversy by disavowing the chants later on Thursday.“I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,” Trump said.When pressed about his failure to stop the chants, Trump said, "I think I did. I started speaking very quickly.” However, footage shows him allowing it to continue for several seconds before he continued his speech. The House voted along party lines this week to condemn Trump's original tweets as racist. Four Republicans broke party ranks to join all Democrats in passing the measure.On Friday, Trump denounced the "crazed" media coverage of his rally, saying he wished the "vile and disgusting statements" made by the progressive lawmakers got as much attention. The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.


If some of former Vice President Joe Biden’s talking points against “Medicare for All” sound familiar, they should. He borrowed them from Republicans.It’s not just that Biden’s health care platform is less progressive than those of his rivals, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), nor is it simply that Biden holds centrist views about the value of competition and choice in the insurance market.It’s worse. At a forum sponsored by the AARP and the Des Moines Register in Iowa, Biden trotted out scare tactics about health care reform that would make President Donald Trump proud. First, Biden promoted his plan, which also would significantly increase the government’s role in health coverage by creating a public option to compete with private insurers and would provide much more generous financial assistance to people covered by policies from the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges. Unlike Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, however, Biden’s would leave the private health insurance market intact.Then Biden began to make the case against Medicare for All. It rested largely on trying to scare old people, a tactic Republicans frequently use to whip up anxiety about any Democratic plan to reform the health care system.“Medicare goes away as you know it. All the Medicare you have is gone,” Biden said as he leaned down toward moderator Kathie Obradovich from the Des Moines Register for effect. “The transition of dropping 300 million people on a new plan ― totally new ― is, I think, kind of a little risky at this point.” As a point of fact, the “Medicare” program envisioned under Medicare for All is not the program as it exists today. Unlike what Biden insinuated, however, it would have more generous benefits and little to no out-of-pocket spending. Senior citizens, like everyone else, would be enrolled in a single-payer, national health care program.This attack utilizes classic Republican “Mediscare” tactics designed to foment discontent among older Americans that anyone else’s gains come at their expense. Trump himself published an op-ed last October in USA Today under the headline “Donald Trump: Democrats ‘Medicare for All’ plan will demolish promises to seniors.” In the op-ed, Trump makes a number of false and exaggerated claims about Medicare for All. But it’s this line that’s most in sync with Biden’s rhetoric: “The Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None.”“Medicare for None” has become a favored talking point in recent months for Republicans like Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Biden should recognize this fear-mongering strategy because McConnell and others used it extensively when President Barack Obama was working to enact the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 and continued to use it to criticize the law. For a candidate so fixated on protecting Obamacare and an ex-vice president who claims partial credit for Obama’s legislative success on health care reform, it’s jarring to hear him parrot those attacks now.Perhaps worse still was Biden’s suggestion that sick people could be hurt during the four-year transition from the current health coverage system to a new, Medicare for All program.Biden asked members of the audience to raise their hands if they’d ever lost a loved one to a terminal illness. “Every second counts. It’s not about a year, it’s about the day, the week, the month, the next six months,” he said. “The truth of the matter is, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride getting to where we’re going.”Biden has been using variations of this line at public events and during press interviews in recent weeks, and the subtext is pretty obvious: Be afraid of Medicare for All because you might die from it. It’s an aspersion straight out of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s heinous “death panels” playbook.Biden’s political nature is more centrist and cautious than that of his most progressive presidential rivals like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). And he’s angling to win by appealing to Democratic voters who are uneasy with the progressive turn the party has taken since losing the 2016 presidential election, which includes older voters.But Trump and McConnell already have the scaring-old-people market covered. And in a crowded field of candidates seeking the votes of an increasingly progressive Democratic electorate, it’s not even clear the tactic will really help Biden. CORRECTION: An earlier version incorrectly reported the year of Sarah Palin’s vice presidential nomination. It was 2008. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.


These must be some pretty interesting times in the Conway household.After President Donald Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen–all of them minorities and all of them American citizens–should “go back to their country,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s attorney husband George Conway, an increasingly vocal Trump adversary, decided to write an op-ed in the Washington Post calling the president a racist.That was on July 15. The very next day, Kellyanne Conway asked a reporter what his ethnicity was. Her explanation? “This was meant with no disrespect. We are all from somewhere else ‘originally’. I asked the question to answer the question and volunteered my own ethnicity: Italian and Irish. Like many, I am proud of my ethnicity, love the USA & grateful to God to be an American.”But then there was a Trump rally on July 17 in Greenville, N.C., where Trump supporters chanted “send her back” (the chant was directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.).For 13 full seconds, Trump stood and watched his supporters chant “Send her back! Send her back!” This is the story of how we got there. https://t.co/0nMqFKaOyr— Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) July 19, 2019Based on her Twitter timeline history (retweets calling the event a “fascist rally”), it seems the following comment from actress and activist Mira Sorvino was related to that: “I am horrified. I’ve been warning everyone for years that this was who Trump was, but many said I was overreacting, criticized my comparisons to Hitler as offensive. I am not wrong;he endangers every American & all we purport to stand for. If we do not impeach it will be too late.”You were right, and all of us who thought you and others who issued similar warnings were overreacting, were terribly wrong. https://t.co/CGnAVRGpTL— George Conway (@gtconway3d) July 19, 2019George Conway responded to this tweet on Friday by saying “You were right, and all of us who thought you and others who issued similar warnings were overreacting, were terribly wrong.”Let’s recap: George Conway appears to believe that Sorvino’s warnings about racism and fascism, and comparisons of Trump to Adolf Hitler, were not overreactions. Those who didn’t see it that way–himself among them– “were terribly wrong,” he said.[Image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images]Matt Naham is managing editor of Law&Crime.

Watch VideosDuring a brief White House Q&A yesterday, a reporter asked Donald Trump about the ongoing talks on raising the debt ceiling ahead of its looming deadline. “We’re working on the debt ceiling,” the president replied.Asked if the negotiations are near an agreement, Trump ignored the question and started whining anew about Barack Obama.“Don’t forget, you know, the debt under President Obama added more debt than every president put together. So you’re talking about a debt ceiling: President Obama added $10 trillion during his eight years. He doubled the debt. He added more debt than every president – every single President put together. President Obama doubled – more than doubled the debt.“So we’re talking about a debt ceiling. The previous president doubled the debt. And that’s what we get stuck with. That’s the way it is, folks.”It was an interesting peek into Trump’s mind. He heard a question about the debt ceiling, which apparently led him to think about the debt, which then apparently led him to seize a perceived opportunity to complain once again about his immediate predecessor.Also note how the Republican takes a couple of sentences and repeats them over and over again, as if that helps. The above transcript excerpt may look like a copy-and-paste error, but he really did repeat himself over the course of several seconds.The fact that Trump’s underlying claim is wildly misleading doesn’t help matters.But even if we put aside these relevant details, we’re left with an awkward question: does the president know what the debt ceiling is?Because cumulative deficits from the Obama era, whether one sees them as problematic or not, have no meaningful relevance to the raising the nation’s borrowing limit now. The necessary increase to the debt ceiling is about paying for current spending – and avoiding default – not addressing previous deficits.Complicating matters, of course, is that Trump is in no position to whine on this subject. As Paul Krugman explained in his new column, “[T]he Trump tax cut caused a huge rise in the budget deficit, which the administration expects to hit $1 trillion this year, up from less than $600 billion in 2016. This tidal wave of red ink is even more extraordinary than it looks, because it has taken place despite falling unemployment, which usually leads to a falling deficit.”And yet, here we are. Perhaps a chart will help drive the point home.This image, which relies on Congressional Budget Office data, shows annual budget deficits since the Reagan era. Red columns point to Republican administrations, blue columns point to Democratic administrations, and red-and-blue columns point to years in which the fiscal year was split between presidents from two different parties.Pay particular attention to the right side of the image. Those shrinking blue columns? Those are the deficits in the Obama era. The growing red columns? Those are the deficits in the Trump era. (The $1 trillion deficit for this year is based on the latest White House projections, which may yet change.)As Catherine Rampbell recently added, “Federal deficits have widened immensely under Trump’s leadership. This is striking not only because he promised fiscal responsibility – at one time even pledging to eliminate the national debt within eight years – but also because it’s a historical anomaly…. Trump’s own policies are to blame for this aberration.”The president yesterday suggested he got “stuck with” a poor fiscal hand, bequeathed by Obama. But that’s ridiculous: Obama’s the one who dramatically shrank the deficits he inherited from the Bush/Cheney administration, while Trump is the one who’s making the deficits dramatically larger now.


Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday said she would “never accept” the Court’s majority ruling allowing political gerrymandering, referring to the practice as an “undermining of democracy.”In a 5-4 decision last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal judiciary could not intervene in striking down congressional voting maps drawn with the specific intention of creating a political advantage for the party in power. In a blistering dissent, Kagan said the decision was “tragically wrong,” warning that it could have disastrous consequences.“Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections,” Kagan wrote.Speaking in front of the Washington Council of Lawyers at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, Kagan said that she didn’t “pull [her] punches” in her gerrymandering dissent because of how important the issue is to our political system.“There’s no part of me that’s ever going to become accepting of the decision made, essentially that courts shouldn’t get involved in gerrymandering no matter how bad it is and no matter how destructive of our political system it is, which is the decision the court reached,” Kagan said.Kagan said that while some dissents are written just to show people that there were two sides to an argument, in this case, her dissent was to illustrate to present and future generations exactly why she believed the case was decided incorrectly. Kagan, you may remember, even saw fit to read her dissent in full (“Her voice cracked as she read it, and she later wiped her face with a tissue,” Bloomberg Law reported).“So, there you’re not just writing the dissent because you saw things differently,” Kagan said. “You’re writing the dissent because you want to convince the future, and you want to convince the present too. And for all those people out there who in some way can carry on the efforts against this kind of undermining of democracy, ‘go for it,’ because you’re right.”Justice Kagan also paid tribute to the late Justice John Paul Stevens, her predecessor on the Supreme Court who died on July 16 following a stroke. She described Stevens as an “extraordinary person” who was “kind, humble, and respectful of everybody.”Kagan also said that Stevens produced an important bloc of legal decisions “not surpassed in modern times,” while approaching the law with an “insistence that our legal institutions be fair.”[image via C-Span screengrab]View AllHave a tip or story idea?

Not even 24 hours after telling reporters that he was “not happy” with the “send her back” chant against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) at his reelection rally earlier this week, President Donald Trump on Friday seemed to be more onboard with the widely condemned message.It is amazing how the Fake News Media became “crazed” over the chant “send her back” by a packed Arena (a record) crowd in the Great State of North Carolina, but is totally calm & accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by the three Radical Left Congresswomen…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019….State which I will win in #2020 because they can’t stand her and her hatred of our Country, and they appreciate all that I have done for them (opening up mining and MUCH more) which has led to the best employment & economic year in Minnesota’s long and beautiful history!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019Trump’s Friday morning tweets are a continuation of his racist attacks against Omar and three other congresswomen of color — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). The President first sparked the controversy Sunday when he tweeted that they should “go back” to the countries they supposedly came from, despite all four being U.S. citizens.When pressed Thursday about why he stood silently as the chant went on during his rally, Trump claimed some credit by arguing that he “started speaking very quickly.” He waited 13 seconds to step in.


The president’s nationalistic rhetoric and policies on immigration may be ramping up, but one voice is conspicuously absent.White House ReporterNational Security ReporterOver the past week, President Donald Trump doubled down on his openly racist attacks on four female minority congresswomen, repeatedly announced nationwide raids on undocumented immigrants, and had his administration roll out a new asylum plan—one that could very well be his greatest threat to migrants yet. And he’s done this all the while being validated, defended, and excused by numerous major players in the Republican Party, once again confirming his nationalist, immigrant-trashing grip on the GOP.All together, it’s been a banner few days for the restrictionist, anti-immigration worldview of Trump and his top lieutenants who have encouraged the president to take a harder line on immigration since the early days of the campaign. Over the last few days, however, one man has been largely absent from the picture, the public tumult, and the cameras. Stephen Miller.Over the years, the 33-year-old senior policy adviser to the president has become virtually synonymous with the draconian immigration measures of the administration. He was a driving force behind the president’s brutal family-separation policy, one of the architects of Trump’s “Muslim travel ban,” constantly agitates against legal immigration levels and refugees, and serves as the top White House speechwriter. Even before he joined Trump’s team in January  2016, he was already proving key, serving, for instance, as the principal author of the  campaign’s immigration “white paper” unveiled in August 2015. As a member of President Trump’s inner circle, Miller’s hard-right influence, specifically on immigration policies, hasn’t abated. But his public and televised presence has stayed, for the most part, conspicuously muted. And that’s explicitly by design on Miller’s part. As his profile has risen, Miller has become increasingly reclusive. According to a senior White House colleague, Miller is very careful what he says on the phone, whether it’s to a fellow administration official or otherwise, in case the call is being recorded or could be used against him. Two other knowledgeable sources say that over the past two years, he’s cut off regular contact with most of his allies outside of the Trump administration and in advocacy groups because he wants to keep his circle of potential leakers as small as he can.And Miller rarely does media appearances. His last major TV hit was in mid-February, when he went on Fox News Sunday to defend President Trump’s declared national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border. In the West Wing, Miller is known for his laser-like focus on policy, and emphatic desire to operate behind-the-scenes and not become the story.Those who have worked closely with Miller attest that he is adept at not infuriating the president, at least when it comes to hogging the limelight, a lesson he learned watching with a careful, calculating eye as Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top White House strategist, rose high within Trump’s orbit, only to be sidelined and denigrated by his boss after too many “President Bannon” media narratives. When Miller realized Bannon’s ouster was near, the senior policy aide turned on Bannon, his former ideological and personal ally, and started trashing Bannon in private conversations with Trump, tagging the strategist as a leaker and a destructive liability. His words helped hasten Bannon’s departure from the Trump White House.Despite his desire to stave off a “President Miller” storyline, he has nonetheless emerged as a prime bête noire for liberal politicians and activists who hold him responsible for much of the human suffering caused under President Trump. According to two people who’ve spoken to him about this, Miller doesn’t at all mind that he’s routinely called a “Nazi” by critics and on social media, despite the fact he is Jewish.“Sometimes he laughs it off, usually he just doesn’t give a shit,” said one senior Trump administration official. “Stephen has ate, slept and breathed immigration policy for the past decade… and he’s the truest of true believers in Trump. So the President can always rest assured that Stephen’s going to execute on his wishes,” Cliff Sims, Trump’s former director of White House message strategy, told The Daily Beast. The two have known each other going back to Miller’s days working in then-Sen. Jeff Sessions’ (R-AL) office when Sims ran an Alabama-based news organization.“The handful of times he’s been public-facing have been as over-the-top as possible in his defense of Trump and advocacy for his policies,” Sims added. “But ultimately he prefers to just keep his head down and work behind the scenes. That’s when he’s most effective.”One way in which Miller has continued to expand his grip on power and influence in the Trump era is through the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this year, Miller successfully lobbied the president to oust multiple senior officials deemed “weak” or insufficiently ruthless on the immigration agenda. This included Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary, who for a year and a half was engaged in a bitter cold war of paranoia and backstabbing with Miller.His word carries weight with the president, so when Trump was looking to fill a top position earlier this year, Miller was among the senior officials who endorsed Ken Cuccinelli in discussions with the president.In Cuccinelli, Trump’s newly installed acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a DHS agency, Miller has found a new reliable ally. The senior White House aide and Cuccinelli see eye-to-eye on issues related to asylum seekers and slashing legal immigration, and Miller is known to proactively call Cuccinelli and his team for regular updates, said a source with knowledge of their relationship. When Trump was looking to fill the role of acting director earlier this year, Miller was among the senior officials who endorsed Cuccinelli in discussions with the president.Indeed, Cuccinelli is merely the latest high-profile example of DHS continuing to be stacked with what some career government officials have privately derided as “mini-Millers.” Or, as one White House official described it, “when Cuccinelli talks or acts [nowadays], pretend you’re looking at or listening to President Trump or Stephen Miller… It’s the same thing.”In his current role, Cuccinelli appears to be less camera-shy than his fellow administration hand Miller. John Cohen, a former senior official at DHS in the Obama administration, said it was “unusual” for the head of USCIS to spend time on national television talking about ICE activities, as Cuccinelli did this month.“In my day, if we had a situation that we were confronting at southern border and we had a dramatic increase in persons requesting protection through asylum, the head of USCIS would be one of the loudest advocates for surging resources to the border...so those claims can be made,” Cohen said. “I haven’t heard much of anything coming from USCIS about how they are going to address the dramatic increase of these people.”Over the last several days, the Trump administration said it would deploy additional resources to ICE field offices to support their investigative or deportation operations. Cohen said those resources are being diverted—under Cuccinelli’s watch—away from USCIS employees who are processing asylum claims. It also happens to be an outcome Miller prefers, according to two sources familiar with the situation.“That has got to be one of the most misguided things I’ve heard in the last several years,” Cohen said. “USCIS should be expanding their resource base so they can effectively address the surge at the southern border. White House ReporterNational Security ReporterGot a tip?

    Germany is marking the 75th anniversary of a famous plot to kill Adolf Hitler, honouring those who resisted the Nazis as pillars of the country's modern democracy. Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute ahead of the anniversary to executed plot leader Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and his fellow conspirators."Only if we understand our past can we build a good future," she said.Colonel von Stauffenberg tried to kill Hitler with a briefcase bomb on July 20, 1944, during a meeting at his headquarters in East Prussia. Hitler escaped the full force of the blast when someone moved the briefcase next to a table leg, deflecting much of the explosion.The plot crumbled when news spread that Hitler had survived. Von Stauffenberg and his fellow conspirators were executed within hours. The story had little resonance in the immediate post-World War II years, when many still viewed the July 20 plotters as traitors, as they had been painted by the Nazis in the aftermath of the failed assassination.The resistance against the Nazis only came to be "labouriously accepted" over subsequent decades, said Johannes Tuchel, director of the German Resistance Memorial Centre, and even in the 1980s many believed its memory would fade away.  Only in 2004 did a survey show that a majority of Germans believed the resistance to the Nazis was "important for [their] political culture," he added."Those who acted on July 20 are an example to us," Ms Merkel said last week in her weekly video message. "They showed that they followed their conscience and set their stamp on a part of German history that otherwise was defined by the darkness of Nazism."Mr Tuchel said von Stauffenberg is a "symbolic figure" of the resistance, an officer who evolved from supporting Nazi policies to becoming a ferocious opponent of the regime after Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. He acknowledged that the resistance within the German military was, in overall terms, tiny: 200 to 300 people were involved in the July 20 plot. The German military had some eight million men under arms at the time, and only "a handful or two" of its more than 1,000 generals and admirals participated.But the memorial Mr Tuchel heads, in the Berlin complex where von Stauffenberg worked and was executed, seeks to display the full breadth of German resistance to Hitler's regime after the Nazis took power in 1933.Students in Munich formed the White Rose movement, distributing pamphlets urging "passive resistance" starting in 1942. Its leaders included siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, who were executed in 1943 and who have also become resistance icons.Helmuth James von Moltke's so-called Kreisau Circle started working in secret to end the dictatorship in 1940.  And in 1938, carpenter Georg Elser attempted to kill Hitler and other senior Nazi leaders at an event in Munich, but was thwarted as the Nazi leader unexpectedly left the room minutes before a bomb exploded.Mr Tuchel conceded that, even now, there are shortcomings in historians' knowledge of the resistance and promised more research in the coming years into the role of women who opposed the Nazi dictatorship, responding to a recent call from Parliament.This year's anniversary comes weeks after the killing of a regional official from Ms Merkel's party who had supported the Chancellor's welcoming approach to migrants. A man with previous convictions for violent anti-migrant crime was arrested as the suspected killer."Today, we are obliged to confront all tendencies that want to destroy democracy — including right-wing extremism," Ms Merkel said in her message.AP

The Chinese station Tiangong-2 is scheduled to drop out of orbit on 19 July and fall into the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand and Chile.Tiangong-2  – which translates as “heavenly palace” – was launched in September 2016, and it was never intended to be a permanent fixture in orbit. Instead, its purpose was to test technologies for China’s larger planned space station, whose main module is scheduled to launch in 2020. That space station is planned to be about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station. Tiangong-2 is far smaller.In October 2016, two astronauts travelled to Tiangong-2 aboard the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft. While on the space station they performed experiments on human physiology in space as well as exploring other areas of science. After about a month they returned home. In 2017, a cargo spacecraft docked with Tiangong-2 three times to test its docking and refueling capabilities.
                    
                        In 2018, Tiangong-2 began to lower its orbit to prepare for the end of its mission. On 19 July, it will fire its thrusters again to aim its descent toward the Pacific Ocean. Most of the craft will probably burn up as it enters the atmosphere, but any parts that survive should splash into the water harmlessly.The space station is still fully functional, and is being brought down purposefully now that it’s finished the experiments it was launched to carry out. This will avoid the fate of its predecessor, Tiangong-1, which lost power in April 2018 and crashed down in an uncontrolled fashion. Its remains also fell into the ocean, but that was simple luck. This time, Chinese officials will make sure that their space station hits water.More on these topics:

					Those locally run ISPs are much more exposed to market forces, not only because they depend on pleasing all their customers, but also because they don't benefit from a government-granted monopoly.Evolution by Variation (supplier competition) and Selection (consumer choice). It's the only way. There is no such thing as Intelligent Design.I am guessing the poster and yourself didn't take economics.  As this isn't evolution but Supply and DemandQuite true, however the problem with modern ISP's is the amount of infrastructure needed.  Back in the dial up days We would have 2 bills to get internet access. One for the phone company (which we could also use for voice) and one for the ISP.You could pay a lot of money for the big name services like AOL or MSN.  Or you could do some research and find inexpensive ISP's that don't have as many busy signals. and offer fast and friendly support.  Because they needed to be competitive with the big names.

While there may be times it is slower I've not noticed issues with shared back hauls in a long time, and even if there were issues is just more marketing BSATT marketing is generally fairly inexplicable. It's cheaper to get access from an ATT reseller than from ATT itself in most markets, and then you wind up talking to TWO sets of support people (at least) every time you have a problem. How can that be cheaper, even for ATT? They wind up talking to both you and to the reseller, too.I will say that I've been on the business side of that *sort* of relationship, though not in that market specifically.I didn't understand it being on the 'customer' end and dealing with it, but I learned that for every call that is going to have to go to the actual provider anyway, there are at least 10 calls where the customer missed something easy on their end and the reseller could take care of it without involving the real provider.That's generally what the provider sees as value in the reseller, able t And here I am out in the middle of no where re-tuning my directional antenna...14 Mbps connection?

In essence, they can focus on a community with a tight and selected set of network connections.  In other words, the environment is gamed for performance.,



A large ISP has to hand a wide variety of conditions -- distant users, poor existing infrastructure, etc.  Not a fair comparison.A large ISP in the US generally has no competition and thus has no real incentive for anything other than to rip people off for crappy service.Commercial ISPs can deny service if it's not commercially feasible. I couldn't get DSL from Verizon because I was 'too far from the central office' when a neighbor had it, was farther away (measured along their cable*) and it worked fine.

(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that US President Donald Trump's racist comments about four Democratic Congresswomen "undermine America's strength" and that she stands in "solidarity" with the women.


New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that she does “not understand” why the United States has failed to change its gun laws in the aftermath of mass shootings.Speaking with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Ardern noted that even though her county has a strong hunting culture and had “pretty permissive gun legislation,” most New Zealanders agreed after the Christchurch attack it was necessary to “draw the line.”On April 10, less than a month after a white supremacist terrorist shot and killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, the country’s parliament voted 119 to one to pass gun control legislation that banned most of the country’s automatic and semiautomatic weapons.Ardern said while there is a “practical purpose and use for guns,” at the same time, “that does not mean you need access to military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles. You do not. And New Zealanders by and large absolutely agreed with that position.”She also compared New Zealand’s legislation to the laws passed in Australia in the aftermath of the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, in which a gunman murdered 35 people at a Tasmania tourist attraction. In both countries, Ardern said, single massacres were enough to galvanize the public to support gun control.“Australia experienced a massacre and changed their laws. New Zealand had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I do not understand the United States,” Ardern said.In 2019 alone, the United States has undergone 122 mass shootings according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people besides the shooter being killed or injured. Four of the five deadliest mass shootings in American history have taken place since 2012, including the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino shooting of Oct. 1, 2017, in which 59 people were killed and more than 500 were injured.In the aftermath of the shooting, Ardern has also established herself as a prominent advocate for combating violent extremism online. The Christchurch perpetrator live-streamed footage of the massacre, which was then disseminated countless times throughout social media.Beginning on Wednesday, Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron are hosting a summit that aims to curb terrorists’ use of social media. Tech giants will be asked to agree to a “Christchurch Call,” to more aggressively combat violent content, according to the New York Times.Write to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.


Reports suggest large-scale stand-off between several coastguard ships from each country near the Spratly Islands.Vietnam has called on China to remove an oil exploration ship from disputed waters near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.Reports in recent days have suggested a large-scale stand-off between several coastguard ships from each country as a Chinese oil exploration ship entered contested waters near the Spratly Islands. "Over the last several days, the Chinese survey ship, Haiyang Dizhi 8, and its escorts conducted activities in the southern area of the East Sea that violated Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf," foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement on Friday, using the Vietnamese term for the South China Sea."This area lies entirely within the Vietnamese waters."Vietnam has demanded China stop the "unlawful activities" and that its ships leave Vietnamese waters, she said.Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper reported on July 12 that six "heavily armed" coastguard vessels, two from China and four from Vietnam, had been eyeing each other since the beginning of the month. Publicly available shipping data confirms the presence of the Chinese oil exploration ship in the disputed waters, near where the Russian oil company Rosneft began drilling on May 12 in a joint venture with Vietnam.Oil exploration in the South China Sea is a highly fraught issue in both countries, which fought a series of violent disputes between 1974 and 1988 over control of the Spratly and Parcel Islands.In 2014, deadly riots broke out throughout Vietnam after a Chinese drilling rig entered the disputed waters, while Vietnam's unexplained decision to suddenly cancel a drilling contract with Repsol in 2017 occurred during heightened tensions with China.China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including waters within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.

The key cooperator faces additional child-porn charges in a new indictment to be unsealed Friday.National Security ReporterGeorge Nader, who was a key witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, has been hit with new federal charges of child pornography, sex trafficking, and obscenity, according to a person familiar with the case. The charges come on top of separate child-porn charges leveled by the same prosecutors last month. The new indictment is set to be unsealed Friday morning in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to the person.The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nader’s attorneys declined to comment. Nader is expected to enter a plea on the charges this morning. Nader, a 60-year-old Lebanese-American businessman with deep political and financial ties to the United Arab Emirates, was a key cooperator in Mueller’s probe of foreign influence in the 2016 election. Nader met several times with individuals associated with the Trump campaign throughout the election and into the early days of the administration. He spoke with officials and advisers on matters ranging from a pitch by a foreign firm for the campaign to use social-media manipulation to regime-change in Iran. (He met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisors about the plan, which included a proposal to use fake avatars to garner support for Trump, but Trump officials deny they ever considered it.)He also helped broker a key meeting between Erik Prince, the former Blackwater CEO, and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of one of Russia’s sovereign wealth funds, in the Seychelles in January 2017. That meeting came under intense scrutiny by Mueller’s team and was described in its report as one of the ways the Russians tried to influence the incoming Trump administration.Federal prosecutors in Virginia argued last month in court that Nader should be held in jail before trial, based in part on his prior criminal history. That history includes a 2003 conviction in the Czech Republic on charges of abusing minors, including a charge of transporting of a minor boy to the U.S. for sexual purposes. Federal prosecutors said Nader has had “hands-on contact with more than a dozen minor boys.” Nader’s lawyers called the U.S. government’s argument weak because he was later acquitted of the Czech sex-trafficking charge. Nader is also charged with transporting child pornography—a charge he’s faced in the past. In 1984, Nader was indicted for possessing child pornography in D.C. The charge was later dismissed after his attorneys argued that the material was found through an illegal search conducted on Nader’s possessions at Dulles International Airport. In 1990, again at Dulles, law enforcement caught Nader with films featuring minor boys. Nader pleaded guilty the following year.Nader most recently faced allegations of possessing and transporting child pornography in 2018. Authorities stopped him at Dulles in January of that year and questioned him about his time working with the Trump team. Soon after, Nader began cooperating with Mueller, and in the spring of 2018 he departed for Dubai, where he lived until he attempted to re-enter the U.S. last month. When stopped at Dulles, the FBI executed a search warrant on Nader’s electronic devices, including three iPhones. After analyzing the phones, the FBI found 12 videos that appeared “to be visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,” according to a criminal complaint filed in 2018 that remained under seal until last month.Nader is also charged with violating federal obscenity law.On June 3, he was arrested at JFK International Airport in New York and transferred to a Virginia jail, where he remains locked up.Last month, prosecutors told a court that FBI agents found dozens of child-porn videos on one of Nader’s phones, with some depicting children as young as 3 years old. The FBI witness for the government said several of those videos were transmitted from Nader’s phone to other individuals. Prosecutors said authorities also found communications between Nader and UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, also known as MBZ.  Nader’s attorneys said he returned to the U.S. for an urgent doctor’s appointment after undergoing major heart surgery in the UAE weeks earlier.National Security ReporterGot a tip?

                                        Abby Michaels is accused of killing a family in a wrong-way crash on St. Patrick's Day. (Photo: Provided/Fox 19)A woman who reportedly caused a wrong-way crash on St. Patrick's Day, killing a family of three, was indicted today for what the prosecutor is calling a "deliberate" act.Abby Michaels, 21, was charged with six counts of murder, six counts of aggravated vehicular homicide and one count of driving under the influence. She faces life in prison if convicted.According to prosecutors, Michaels left a bar in Miamisburg intoxicated on Sunday, March 17. People at the bar advised her against driving, said Montgomery County Prosecutor Mat Heck Jr.Michaels didn't listen to their cautions and proceeded to drive the wrong way down the northbound side of I-75, just south of Dayton near the Dryden Road exit, Heck said. Witnesses said she accelerated before her white Kia Forte hit a Toyota Camry head on.Timmy Thompson, 51, Karen Thompson, 50, and their 10-year-old daughter, Tessa, were returning home from vacation to their Mason home when Michaels hit their car. All three of them died in the crash. This photo of Tim, Tessa and Karen Thompson was at services for the family this week at St. Susanna Church in Mason. (Photo: Sonia Chopra for The Enquirer)Heck said Michaels told people in advance that she planned to do this. He said it wasn't clear if this was a suicide attempt."This was not an accident," Heck said. "This defendant was upset and decided to take the action that she did. Evidence showed this defendant knew what she was doing and what she wanted to accomplish. Unfortunately, what she accomplished was wiping out and murdering this family." Timmy Thompson, 51, Karen Thompson, 50, and their 10-year-old daughter, Tessa, were killed after a wrong-way driver struck their vehicle Sunday evening. (Photo: Facebook)Heck said she showed no hesitancy and that the fact that she accelerated prior to the crash shows this was an intentional action. He also said the fact that she was under the influence was not a contributing factor.Michaels is currently in custody, Heck said. She will have her first court hearing on Tuesday, July 23 at 8:30 a.m.Enquirer media partner Fox 19 contributed to this report. 


Russia has offered to sell its own fighter jets to Turkey after the U.S. canceled a recent sale due to Ankara's purchase of Moscow's missile system and considered selling elsewhere.Sergei Chemezov, head of the state-run Rostec industrial conglomerate, told reporters Thursday that, "if our Turkish colleagues express an interest, we are ready to discuss the deliveries of Su-35," according to the RIA Novosti news outlet. The Su-35, an advanced version of the Su-27, is meant to bridge the gap between fourth- and fifth-generation fighter jets like the U.S.-built F-35 that was originally to be acquired by Turkey until President Donald Trump formally canceled the delivery Tuesday.Though Trump himself had remarked that the situation was "unfair," the decision came after the State Department and Pentagon repeatedly warned Turkey not to acquire Russia's state-of-the-art S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile system, fearing Moscow could use the weapon to collect sensitive data from the advanced F-35. The Turkish Foreign Ministry echoed Trump's words in calling it "not fair" Tuesday, arguing that the U.S. claims were "baseless" as well as against "the spirit of alliance" that bound them as members of the NATO military coalition."We call upon the United States to return from this mistake that will cause irreparable wounds in our strategic relations," the ministry said in a statement.Su-35 manufacturer Sukhoi described the Su-35 as "a multi-purpose, super-maneuverable fighter of the fourth-plus-plus generation" that received its "baptism of fire" through its participation in Syria, where Moscow and Ankara have backed opposing sides of an eight-year civil war. Though Russia joined Iran in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey remained the last major sponsor of insurgents looking to overthrow him, the two powers have grown closer.At the same time, they have both drifted further from the U.S., which originally backed Syrian rebels before switching to a mostly Kurdish alliance that included separatist militias considered to be terrorist organizations by Turkey. The U.S. also opposed Assad and has sought to limit both Russia and Iran's influence abroad through economic restrictions.The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia's defense industry in order to discourage foreign buyers interested in weapons such as the S-400, which has already been purchased by Belarus, China and India. Others who have expressed interest in purchasing the system include Iraq, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which has apparently opted to instead purchase the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system designed only to intercept missiles, not aircraft too like the S-400.Washington has already sanctioned Beijing for its purchase of S-400s and Su-35s, though Chinese officials were reportedly seeking more of both. The U.S. has also threatened sanctions against Turkey, though Trump has signaled he would not do so.The U.S. still has a long list of customers for the F-35. Buyers already included Australia, Canada, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, who led the F-35 program until earlier this month, told the House Armed Services Committee in April that potential future users "include Singapore, Greece, Romania, Spain and Poland."Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini cited sources last month saying that Athens was seriously considering buying the F-35, especially as it looked to shore up defense ties with the Pentagon amid a dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean.Greece and Turkey's longstanding rivalry has begun to resurface as the two countries, both NATO allies, engaged in a feud over Ankara's decision to drill for oil and gas off the coast of Northern Cyprus. The territory remains under Turkish control after a 1974 invasion of the island nation whose southern, sovereign half has close political and cultural links to Greece.Turkey has ignored EU sanctions for its resource exploration in the region and the topic came up during Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias' meeting Wednesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. Dendias said the two "had the opportunity to exchange views on various issues, the most important one being ⁠—and always will be⁠—the issue of Turkish aggression, both towards Cyprus, the sovereignty and sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus, and towards Greece's sovereign rights in the wider region of the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean."He added: "I would like to stress that I asked the United States to adopt a clear position, to clearly support Greece with regard to issues of Turkish aggression."© 2019 Newsweek

    Democratic staffers for the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees say that lawmakers intend to press former special counsel Robert Mueller to tell a "much clearer narrative" to the American people about the president's conduct, laid out in the findings of Mueller's final report about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government. "As we know from his press conference, that not everybody is reading the book but people will watch the movie," staff members said of the upcoming hearing next Wednesday. In a background briefing held on Capitol Hill in advance of next week's hearing, Democratic staff for the Judiciary Committee said that the report "lays out the dots" but "they don't connect any of the dots, at least through the most significant instances that we're so interested in." Mueller's testimony was delayed a week as lawmakers continued to hash out details of the former FBI Director's testimony. According to the Democratic committee staff, lawmakers plan to focus on five different instances they think would incur criminal charges for obstruction of justice if any other individual besides the president had carried out these actions: "We want every American to understand that you have a president who has committed the most serious kinds of offenses possible," staffers said. Staffers expect Mueller to "lean into" the factual findings and legal conclusions, but they worry that it's easy to get lost in such findings.They said lawmakers will "respect" the fact that Mueller has been very clear about not wanting to give his personal opinion on whether Mr. Trump broke the law and understand Mueller feels he has to stay within the four corners of the report, but they think his language is strong enough in the report that they can connect it to the ultimate conclusion on obstruction. In light of that assessment, staffers say they don't expect a "big, dramatic new revelation." Mueller has appeared before the committee many times in his 50 years of public service, and they know he doesn't volunteer more information than necessary. "We're taking that into account as we prepare how to best elicit answers from him," staffers said. As for the Intelligence Committee, lawmakers want to focus on the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Trump campaign's contacts, communications and links to Russia during the election. "What Volume One actually shows is that Russia did engage in a shocking attack on…our democracy. But even more so that instead of going to law enforcement, the Trump campaign…after learning about it, the Trump campaign instead welcomed it," Intel staffers said. While the Judiciary Committee will spend three hours for questioning and the Intelligence Committee will have two hours, neither committee expects Mueller to give lengthy, extensive answers to lawmakers' probes. They anticipate "yes" or "no" answers or very short sentences. But they believe that their hearings will nonetheless help Americans better understand the report. Emily Tillett contributed reporting

Witnesses say Shinji Aoba claimed he started deadly blaze over plagiarisation dispute
Gavin Blair in Kyoto

Japanese police have named a 41-year-old man suspected of carrying out an arson attack on an animation studio that killed 33 people.Witnesses said Shinji Aoba confessed to the massacre as he was arrested. He was allegedly overheard telling police he started the fire because the studio, Kyoto Animation, had copied his ideas and stolen his novel.Were it not for the three-storey burnt-out building visible over the tops of the houses along the narrow backstreets of Rokujizo in the Fushimi Ward of Kyoto, it would be hard to believe the area was the scene of the biggest mass killing in Japan in living memory.On Thursday, Aoba allegedly burst into the building carrying 40 litres of petrol and a bag full of hammers and knives and set fire it. In addition to the scores of studio staff who were killed in the blaze, 35 were injured.A chalk outline on the ground where Aoba was found lying is just behind a police cordon blocking the streets leading to the studio, where young artists created anime that won fans across Japan and beyond. The narrow streets had made it difficult for the dozens of emergency vehicles to reach the building, according to witnesses.Keiyu Hada, a high-school student, was walking past the studio on Thursday morning with his mother when he saw the studio ablaze.“We were about 10 metres away, but the heat was so intense on my face it was unbearable. There were three people outside that I saw had come out of the building. They were on fire; their clothes and hair were burning,” said Keiyu, whose family looks after and lives at the local Buddhist temple.“After a while, I couldn’t stand to look, so we went back to the temple. Some people from the neighbourhood came with us, they thought there might be another explosion.”There were firefighters at the scene but it took a further 10-15 minutes before more arrived with hoses, Keiyu said. “I wonder if they had been quicker more people could have been saved, but I think it was hard for them to drive down there.”Under grey skies on Friday, a steady stream of mourners stopped to lay flowers. Others simply put their hands together and made long, silent bows in the direction of the building’s charred remains.Shoumyou Oh, a 23-year-old from China, made the trip down on the bullet train from Tokyo, where he is studying Japanese, to pay his respects.“Kyoto Animation’s productions are very popular in China – I have known them since I was in junior high school. They make anime and stories that touch your heart. This news was trending top yesterday on Weibo, the Chinese Twitter,” he said.“I can’t understand why someone would do this. I want to hear the reason from the criminal.”Shortly after, the police had named the man they have in custody in hospital as Aoba.“He is badly burned on his hands, feet, chest and face; his hair has been burnt off. We are waiting for word from the doctors as to when we can question him,” Hiroyuki Sakai, the deputy chief of the local Fushimi police station told the Guardian.Sakai confirmed 19 bodies had been found on the third floor and the staircase leading to the roof, with some piled on top of others, suggesting they were scrambling to escape.Fushimi Ward usually had a low crime rate, said Sakai, and there had not been a single murder there last year, though a woman fatally stabbed a man in March during a domestic dispute.About 100 police and medical examiners are working on the KyoAni case. An investigation headquarters has been set up in a gym in the the Kyoto police training centre as the local station is too small to cope.“Five autopsies were carried out today. The bodies of the victims are in different states, depending how and where they died,” Sakai said.“There will be more autopsies done in the coming days. Once everyone has been identified and the families informed, we will release the names of the victims.”The suspect has yet to be arrested or charged. If he is, prosecutors will almost certainly seek the death penalty.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019This was one of several tweets Trump fired off on Friday amid widespread criticism both over his racist tweets and over a "send her back" chant shouted at his rally. He wrote that "I am not" a racist and declared the media "crazed" for its reaction to the chants, even after saying on Thursday he disavows them. "I was not happy with it," Trump said. Brendan MorrowDownright nightmarish Cats trailer stuns critics: 'My eyes are bleeding'The Cats trailer dropped into all of our lives on Thursday with little warning, leaving unsuspecting viewers everywhere stunned by whatever unspeakable horror it is that director Tom Hooper is set to unleash into theaters this Christmas.The footage released on Thursday was the first time the public at large got a glimpse at the film's use of so-called "digital fur technology" to morph its star-studded cast into CGI cats, and let's just say Universal was likely hoping for a different reaction."My eyes are bleeding," critic Kristy Puchko wrote, adding, "There is no god." For The Ringer, Kate Halliwell decided the trailer is "the worst thing I've ever seen," asking a series of 66 questions ranging from "What fresh hell is this?" to "has God abandoned me?" The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert faced a similar emotional crisis, writing, "Am I high? ... Is this the final glitch in The Matrix that ushers in the end times?"The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon, meanwhile, wrote that the trailer has "shaken me to my core," while Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson summed it up best by asking, "What. And how. And what. And why. And what." Critics were shocked by everything from how bizarre the cats' faces look to how weirdly small they are on the giant sets to, well, basically everything else about the entire enterprise. Even director Jordan Peele got in on the pile-on, responding to a video adding the creepy Us trailer music onto the Cats footage with his seal of approval. On YouTube, the reaction hasn't been much kinder or less confused. Universal's official upload of the trailer currently has more dislikes than likes, with comments such as "I'm terrified" and "Why are you doing this to us?" Whatever the answers might be, audiences have five months to prepare themselves for this no doubt distressing theatrical experience, as Cats hits theaters on Dec. 20.   Brendan MorrowMicrosoft earnings beat expectations on cloud computing growthMicrosoft on Thursday reported earnings that far exceeded Wall Street's expectations due partly to strong ongoing growth from its Azure cloud services and LinkedIn. The software giant reported profit of $13.19 billion, or $1.71 a share, up from $8.87 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the same period last year. Analysts had expected profit of $1.21 a share, MarketWatch reports.Microsoft wrapped up its 2019 fiscal year with $36.8 billion in net profit, a 21.6 percent increase over the previous year. Sales increased by more than 14 percent. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects sales and operating profit to continue growing by double digits in the coming fiscal year, too. Microsoft shares gained more than 1 percent in after-hours trading after closing up by 0.1 percent on Thursday. Harold MaassJohn Delaney's staff is reportedly urging him to drop out of the 2020 raceThe second round of Democratic presidential debates could be former congressman John Delaney's swan song, as if his team get its way, he'll drop out of the race not long after.The 2020 Democrat's staffers recommended on July 9 that he drop out of the 2020 race by mid-August after thinking he "flopped" during the first Democratic debate and is virtually assured of being shut out of third one in September, Axios reports. Delaney, who has been polling at less than one percent, did qualify for the second round of Democratic debates later this month, but the threshold is being raised starting in September, and Delaney is one of a number of candidates expected to not meet the new requirements.According to this report, Delaney "seemed open" to dropping out this summer during a recent meeting with his staffers, although he still wanted to hang in there long enough to attend the second debate. He's set to participate in the second round's first night, debating alongside Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on a separate night than former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).If Delaney, who sources close to the campaign complained about to Axios by saying that "every other day he would have a different position," does leave the race soon, he could be the second major 2020 dropout after Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). Then again, with reports of turmoil within the campaign of former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, the question of which 2020 candidate named John will next drop out on the advice of their frustrated staffers may be a real nail-biter. Brendan MorrowIran is denying that the U.S. destroyed one of its dronesIran is now denying that one of its drones was destroyed by the United States after President Trump announced on Thursday that the U.S. Navy had done so.Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday tweeted that "we have not lost any drone" after Trump said that the U.S.S. Boxer destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz that came within 1,000 yards and would not stand down. "I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!" Araghchi also wrote.We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!— Seyed Abbas Araghchi (@araghchi) July 19, 2019"This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters," Trump said upon announcing that the Iranian drone had been destroyed, CNN reports. His announcement came amid escalating tensions with Iran and a month after Iran shot down a U.S. drone in the Strait of Hormuz, nearly prompting Trump to launch a retaliatory strike that he says he called off with 10 minutes to spare.A spokesperson for the Pentagon also said on Thursday that the Iranian drone was destroyed by the U.S. after coming "within a threatening range," The New York Times reports. Iran's military spokesman denied Trump's claim as well, The Washington Post reports, saying that "all Iranian drones" in the Strait of Hormuz "including the one which the U.S. mentioned ... have returned to their bases. Brendan MorrowCheering supporters welcome Rep. Ilhan Omar back to MinnesotaRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was greeted by throngs of cheering supporters when she arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Thursday night.It's been a rocky week for Omar, starting with President Trump telling her and three other Democratic women of color to "go back" to their home countries. On Wednesday night, Trump brought Omar up during a rally in North Carolina, and accused her of "launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds." The crowd started chanting, "Send her back!" and while Trump did not say anything during the rally, on Thursday he claimed he was "not happy" and tried to stop it.Omar heard different cheers on Thursday night, as supporters welcomed her back. Before heading to a town hall, Omar — one of Trump's most vocal critics — told supporters she would "continue to be a nightmare to this president, because his policies are a nightmare to us. We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready. We are in the ring. We are in the people's house, and we are going to continue to fight it until we have the America we know we all deserve."Linda Garrett-Johnson told The Star Tribune she came to the airport to show Omar that "Minnesota is standing with her." Garrett-Johnson said she was horrified by Trump's comments, adding that she "heard things like that growing up a person of color. I didn't ever think that I would ever live to hear it from the president of the United States." Catherine GarciaEvery night, these sisters read bedtime stories online to kids around the worldEvery night at 8 p.m. on the dot, sisters Zaria and Hailey Willard grab a few books, turn on their computer, and get settled in for a story time accessible to anyone with an internet connection.Zaria, 13, and Hailey, 8, live in Dover, Delaware, and love to read — their mother, Victoria Willard, told Good Morning America their home is filled with books, and she read to her daughters before they were even born. Knowing that not everyone has the luxury of a large library or someone to read to them, the sisters decided they would step in, using Facebook Live to host a bedtime story session every night. "Reading is good for you," Hailey said.On Sundays, they head to the library and check out the books for the week, making sure to select stories about "characters who look like us," Zaria said. The girls take turns reading, and their mother monitors everything. Their father is in the Navy, and the sisters are working on their next big project: writing and illustrating a series of books about military families. Catherine GarciaTrump has raised more money in California this year than most 2020 DemocratsWhile California is definitely a blue state, there are deep red pockets throughout, and President Trump's supporters in those areas are opening up their wallets.California residents have donated more money to Trump's re-election campaign than to most of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, The Guardian reports. The nonprofit CalMatters found that since January 1, Trump has raised $3.2 million in the state. Just two Democrats have brought in more: Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who has raised $7.5 million, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has raised $5.1 million.Trump has received hefty donations from people in Beverly Hills and San Diego, but 92.8 percent of contributions have come from donors giving less than $100, with most living in the more conservative central part of the state. He has an edge over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has raised $2.2 million in California, 89.6 percent of which came from contributors donating less than $100. All together, the Democratic candidates have raised more than $26 million in the state. Catherine Garcia

The fund and the appeal for money were launched on Friday in the Nigerien capital Niamey, on the sidelines of a forum of governors from the eight regions.Sweden pledged around $8 million (around 7 million euros), the LCBC said, while the European Union (EU), Britain and Germany promised "assistance".Lake Chad's decline has impoverished many families, prompting young people to join the jihadists.The UN estimates that 10.7 million people in the region depend on food aid.   bh/pgf/sch/ri© 2019 AFPThe page no longer exists or did not exist at all.

2 Min Read(Reuters) - A key gauge of China’s debt has topped 300% of gross domestic product, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), as Beijing steps up support for the cooling economy while trying to contain financial risks. China’s total corporate, household and government debt rose to 303% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019, from 297% in the same period a year earlier, the IIF said in a report this week which highlighted rising debt levels worldwide. The IIF is a private global financial industry association, based in Washington. “While authorities’ efforts to curb shadow bank lending (particularly to smaller companies) have prompted a cutback in non-financial corporate debt, net borrowing in other sectors has brought China’s total debt to over $40 trillion - some 15% of all global debt,” the report said.  “Of note, onshore bond issuance suggests a big pickup in borrowing by local governments and banks this year.” China’s economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure. To revive investment and protect jobs, Beijing has been encouraging banks to lend more, particularly to struggling smaller firms. It has also unveiled billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In the first half of this year, local governments’ total net bond issuance reached 2.1765 trillion yuan ($316.5 billion), the finance ministry said on Tuesday. Chinese officials have said repeatedly said debt risks are manageable overall. Reporting by Asia Economics and Markets Desk; Editing by Richard BorsukAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Virtually every state in the Union elects its governor and other statewide offices by popular vote. Mississippi does something different. First, a candidate must win a majority of the statewide popular vote. Second, they must also win a plurality of the vote in a majority of Mississippi House of Representatives districts. If a candidate does both, they win. If they don’t, the Mississippi House chooses the winner. As with the Electoral College, the popular vote in Mississippi only matters until it doesn’t.In May, four black Mississippians represented by voting-rights groups filed a federal lawsuit against the state to challenge the second requirement. That “electoral-vote rule,” as they called it, “creates a system in which white-preferred candidates can win a majority of House districts with a smaller percentage of the statewide popular vote than would be required of an African-American-preferred candidate.” The lawsuit claims it violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the “one-person, one-vote” rule.The plaintiffs are unequivocally correct that the system—which does not apply to U.S. senator elections—was designed to suppress their electoral power. And yet they might still lose. Earlier this week, the state argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed under two recent Supreme Court cases on partisan gerrymandering. The lawsuit—and Mississippi’s response to it—shows how these Roberts Court rulings are already being wielded in defense of antidemocratic systems.More than a century ago, Mississippi structured its statewide elections in this way to preserve white supremacy. The state’s white leaders adopted the electoral system when they redrafted the state constitution in 1890. They ditched the charter drafted during Reconstruction to protect multiracial democracy and replaced it with one designed to suppress black political power. Every weapon in Jim Crow’s arsenal was deployed: The new constitution imposed literacy tests, poll taxes, criminal disenfranchisement provisions, and more.Though black voters outnumbered white voters in the state at the time, the 1890 constitution apportioned the state legislature to guarantee a majority of seats would be held by white lawmakers. That apportionment also affected the statewide election plan: Even if a black-supported candidate received a majority of votes, it would be almost impossible for him to clinch victory by also capturing a majority of the state House of Representatives districts. Lawmakers in those districts would then be able to elevate the second-place candidate to the governor’s mansion. Mississippi’s white leaders did not disguise their intentions. “There is no use to equivocate or lie about the matter,” James K. Vardaman, one of the constitution’s framers as well as a future governor and senator, once boasted. “Mississippi’s constitutional convention of 1890 was held for no other purpose than to eliminate the nigger from politics.”The effects were startling. In a 1965 federal voting-rights case against the state, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that 50 percent of qualified black Mississippians were registered to vote before the new constitution’s adoption. By 1899, that number had dropped to 5 percent. “Amite County, Mississippi, the registrar of which was one of the defendants here, had a white voting age population of 4,449 with white registration of 3,295, while it had 2,560 colored persons of voting age, of whom only one was a registered voter,” Justice Hugo Black wrote for the court, citing a Justice Department filing. “There is no need to multiply examples.”The Warren Court and the civil rights movement swept away poll taxes and literacy tests in the 1960s. But Mississippi’s statewide election system endured, as did its structural biases. “Due to racially polarized voting and the geographic and electoral concentration of the racial groups among the House districts,” the plaintiffs in the recent lawsuit told the court, “a white-preferred candidate does not even need to win a majority of the popular vote to win a majority of the House districts, while an African-American-preferred candidate must obtain at least 55 percent of the popular vote to win a majority of House districts and thus satisfy the Electoral-Vote Rule.”Mississippi did not challenge the plaintiffs’ assertions about history. Instead, it argued they had no right to bring the case at all, telling the court that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to bring the case because they had not proved that the system would injure them as individuals. “That allegation is the epitome of a generalized grievance over which the Court lacks jurisdiction,” Mississippi told the court. The state relied on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Gill v. Whitford last year, where the justices returned to the lower courts a challenge to Wisconsin’s gerrymandered state legislative maps.When the court first agreed to hear Gill and a similar case, many observers expected the justices would clarify whether and how the federal courts should intervene in cases of extreme partisan gerrymandering. Instead, they told the lower courts to reconsider whether the plaintiffs had each been harmed by the Wisconsin gerrymander. “[The plaintiff’s case is] about group political interests, not individual legal rights,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “But this Court is not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences. The Court’s constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.”This conceptualization of gerrymandering doesn’t make sense if you think about it for more than five minutes. Wisconsin’s challenged map warped the entire state legislature in favor of Republicans, a clear aggregate effect that might not be apparent in each district in isolation. Nonetheless, Roberts’s words gave Mississippi the ammunition it needed. “Plaintiffs allege no facts to show that they live in ‘cracked’ or ‘packed’ districts,” the state argued, citing language from Gill. “Thus, the court should not allow Plaintiffs to pursue this ‘case about group political interests’ because Plaintiffs do not allege the abridgment of any individual legal rights and the Court is ‘not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences.’”On the allegation that the system violated the “one-person, one-vote” rule, Mississippi turned to the Supreme Court’s most recent decision on partisan gerrymandering for help. “That is nothing more than a partisan gerrymandering claim over which the Court has no jurisdiction,” the state argued, citing last month’s ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause. That case decided what the ruling in Gill had only delayed. Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by the other four conservative justices, held that the federal courts lacked the power to remedy cases of partisan gerrymandering.Mississippi drew upon Roberts’s language at length to question the idea that this year’s statewide elections would fall along the racial lines described by the plaintiffs. “Voters elect individual candidates in individual districts, and their selections depend on the issues that matter to them, the quality of the candidates, the tone of the candidates’ campaigns, the performance of an incumbent, national events or local issues that drive voter turnout, and other considerations,” Roberts wrote in Rucho. “Many voters split their tickets. Others never register with a political party, and vote for candidates from both major parties at different points during their lifetimes.” Citing those words, Mississippi argued that it is “impossible to predict how and why voters act.”The plaintiffs disagreed. They argued that the state’s electorate is “highly racially polarized,” with black voters overwhelmingly voting Democratic and white voters overwhelmingly voting Republican. “For example, in the two U.S. Senate elections in Mississippi in 2008, African-American voters supported the Democratic candidates by an estimated 90 percent, and white voters supported the Republican candidates by an estimated 81 percent to 90 percent,” they told the court. “The results of the most recent gubernatorial race further demonstrate this division. There, Republican candidate Phil Bryant defeated Democratic candidate Robert Gray by prevailing in every single one of the 80 majority-white House districts.” Since only roughly one-third of districts are majority-black, the average Democratic candidate will find it much harder to win a race than the average Republican candidate, even if he or she wins the popular vote.If the courts can’t intervene, what’s left for Mississippi voters to do? In Rucho, Roberts wrote that voters could turn to other mechanisms to remedy structural problems like partisan gerrymandering. He pointed to two avenues for change. One was congressional action—but the Constitution’s federalist structure likely prevents Congress from changing how states hold nonfederal statewide elections. The other was by ballot initiative. In Mississippi, signatures on initiative petitions must be evenly distributed among the five congressional districts as they existed after the 1990 census. That leaves amending the state constitution by a two-thirds vote in both houses of the legislature. In short, in order to change the statewide election system, reformers in Mississippi would need the assent of those who benefit the most from it.Anyone with a page of history and a volume of logic, to paraphrase Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, can understand why Mississippi’s statewide election system exists: to give an electoral edge to candidates preferred by white voters over those preferred by black voters. But the Roberts Court’s rulings on structural democracy ask that judges look away from what’s right in front of them. Voters are treated as atomized participants in the democratic process, so that systemic disenfranchisement can be dismissed as mere supposition. Historical and political trends are politely ignored, and so are their effects. The result does not guarantee white supremacy on its own, but it makes white supremacy considerably harder to fight.Matt Ford is a staff writer at The New Republic.Copyright 2019 © The New Republic.

(WASHINGTON) — Long before President Donald Trump turned up the heat on four Democratic congresswomen of color, saying they should “go back” to their home countries, hateful rhetoric and disinformation about the self-described squad was lurking online.Racist, inflammatory and inaccurate content has circulated on far right blogs, news sites and social media accounts about Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and her three freshman colleagues since they ran for public office. With his tweets and harsh comments, Trump has elevated that rhetoric, playing into a conspiratorial feedback loop that reared its head repeatedly during his campaign and presidency.Trump rose to conservative prominence by falsely claiming former President Barack Obama, the first black president, wasn’t born in the country. Since then, he has promoted claims and memes that originated in the darkest corners of the internet while fueling new ones of his own.His latest targets are Omar and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.In his Sunday tweets, Trump claimed, without identifying the women by name, that the minority legislators “originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.” He suggested they should “go back” to those “totally broken and crime infested places,” even though three of the four were born in the U.S. and all are U.S. citizens. He has since questioned the women’s allegiance to their country, accusing them of hating America and promoting terrorism while suggesting they should leave America if they’re unhappy here.For some, the Republican president’s tweets were shocking. But for others, they were just an average day on Facebook or Twitter, where allegations that Omar was not legitimately elected, is not a U.S. citizen and committed immigration fraud have festered in far right chatrooms, blogs and social media sites since she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016.“This is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms or it’s happening on national TV,” Omar said this week. “And now it’s reached the White House garden.”Omar was born in Somalia and immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in 1995 when she was a child. She became a U.S. citizen in 2000 at age 17.The rumors about her have been spread by dozens of conservative social media figures and bloggers, including Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer, the latter now banned from Facebook. In February, self-described far right social media influencers Jacob Wohl and Loomer flew to Minneapolis, where they provided live updates on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook of their trip to “investigate” Omar’s past and immigration status. Even seemingly everyday citizens have taken to social media to upload their own theories on Omar’s background, with one Minnesota woman posting a video months ago on Facebook sharing “proof” Omar is not a U.S. citizen. The video has been watched more than 50,000 times.Trump also repeated a contested claim, characterizing as “fact” that Omar had married her brother, before acknowledging that he really didn’t know.“Well, there’s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother,” Trump said this week in response to a question posed by a conservative news outlet. “I know nothing about it. I hear she was married to her brother. You’re asking me a question about it. I don’t know, but I’m sure that somebody will be looking at that.”Omar has described such allegations as “disgusting lies.” She has declined to provide access to immigration records, birth certificates or other documents that could verify her family history.Omar, the biggest target of online vitriol among the four legislators, has made comments that raise eyebrows, including a remark this spring in which she referenced the Sept. 11 attacks by saying that “some people did something.” She was also criticizing for asking a judge in 2016 to show leniency toward a man accused of trying to join the Islamic State.But other allegations have been provably false.Before they took office, for instance, Omar and Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to Congress, were dogged by false online allegations that they were so anti-American they did not intend to take the oath of office. Others tried to delegitimize Omar in memes that falsely claim Obama resettled 70,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota in an effort to ensure her election. In fact, the state received 6,320 Somali refugees during the Obama administration. A similar inaccurate claim was later floated online about Iraqi refugees in Tlaib’s home state of Michigan.Other comments by the women have been taken widely out of context. Around February, social media users and fringe sites began circulating an edited 2013 clip that they said showed Omar “laughing” at al-Qaida and admitting to taking a “terrorism” class.The full context of the 28-minute interview, originally broadcast on a local Minneapolis TV station, shows she was talking about a U.S. college course and was making a point about how the Arabic language had been hijacked by extremist groups to mean something negative.In the 2016 presidential election, Russians relied on a similar online playbook, deploying anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in an effort to boost Trump’s prospects.Racially divisive content was the biggest component of the Russian disinformation campaign, according to Ian Vanderwalker, counsel for the Democracy Program at the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice. One Facebook post linked to a Russian agent, for instance, featured a group of women walking in headdresses and asked: “What are they hiding?”“A lot of it was fearmongering that was intended to mobilize right-leaning voters,” Vanderwalker said. “Some of it was similar to or echoed themes in Trump’s own campaign.”He predicted Russians would revive racially fraught social media content in 2020.Negative sentiment about the four congresswomen has migrated into more mainstream outlets recently. Last week, just days before Trump’s incendiary tweets, Fox News host Tucker Carlson described Omar on his show as having “undisguised contempt for the United States.”The president’s comments, in turn, appear to have inspired even more negative online rhetoric, including a new batch of Facebook and Twitter posts that describe Omar as a “terrorist.” Memes also have emerged calling the women “anti-American” and “enemies within.” One mock movie poster labels the women “The Jihad Squad” and includes the tagline: “Political Jihad is their game.”The attacks are part of a pattern for Trump, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a recent book about how Russian hackers and trolls influenced Trump’s election. She pointed to Trump’s birther claims against Obama, which she said suggested “he doesn’t belong here, he belongs somewhere else,” as well as Trump’s unfounded claims in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and Obama were co-founders of the Islamic State group.Chants at the president’s rallies — such as “Lock her up!” in reference to Clinton or the newly minted “Send her back!” refrain for Omar — emerge because Trump has cast the women as enemies of the nation, Jamieson said.The result, she said, is to discredit “the loyalty, patriotism and ability to act on behalf of the U.S. of an elected official.”Contact us at editors@time.com.


Most of the country is entering into the first few hours of a blistering heat wave that will extend well into the weekend.Dangerous combinations of high temperatures and humidity will push the “heat index” (what the temperature “feels like”) past 100 degrees Fahrenheit from the Dakotas down to Texas and across to Maine and Florida, an area encompassing well over half of the country’s population.But as countless studies have made clear, the kind of extreme heat waves this country, Europe, and elsewhere have been experiencing this summer and last have been made more intense and more likely thanks to human caused global warming.Even worse, if we fail to significantly curb emissions of carbon pollution — which is the current plan put forth by President Donald Trump’s climate policies — then these severe and deadly heatwaves will become the normal summer weather over the next few decades.In fact, a peer-reviewed study published this week warns that if we don’t reverse emissions trends quickly and sharply, we will see a rise in unprecedented heat waves that will “break” the National Weather Service’s heat index scale.The researchers warn we will face extended scorchers more brutal than the United States has ever experienced before. In several decades, parts of Florida and Texas could experience a heat index for five or more months per year exceeding 100 degrees, “with most of these days even surpassing 105 degrees.”The administration’s own studies confirm this. Typical five-day heat waves in the U.S. will be 12 degrees warmer by mid-century alone, according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), which the White House itself reviewed and approved last November.They approved a report finding Trump's climate policies would devastate America	Other studies also show the devastating heat-related impacts the nation and the world face from Trump’s policies of abandoning the Paris climate deal, undoing Obama-era climate rules, and boosting carbon pollution.For instance, America (and much of the world) will start seeing monster “humid heat waves” — where the heat index hits a potentially fatal 131 degrees — every other year by century’s end.	Heat wave records have been breaking at an astonishing rate in recent days around the country and around the globe.We know that human-caused (anthropogenic) carbon pollution and global warming is now the leading factor driving such records. A 2016 study in Nature Scientific Reports, led by climatologist Michael Mann, concluded, “In summary, our results suggest that the recent record temperature years are roughly 600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred under conditions of anthropogenic [climate change] than in its absence.”The extreme heat waves in Europe, Asia, and now the U.S. are driven by “persistent (‘stuck’) extreme weather patterns,” as Mann explained to ThinkProgress in an email. His research and others have shown that “a widely meandering, slowed jetstream” favors these stalled weather extremes and that “this pattern is favored by human-caused climate change, giving us more frequent persistent weather extremes like we are seeing right now.”So, what about the future?The congressionally-mandated NCA — the “authoritative assessment of the science of climate change, with a focus on the United States” — projects under its “higher emissions” scenario a stunning 8 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit average warming over the interior of this country by late in the century.But the NCA also makes clear that temperature extremes rise at an even faster rate than average temperatures.For instance, the average temperature over the country is projected to rise about 9 degrees by late in the century (2071-2100) in the high emissions scenario, which is one where the Paris climate agreement fails and climate action stalls.But, also under this scenario, the temperature of the warmest five-day period during a once-in-a-decade heat wave is projected to rise some 12 degrees just by mid-century (2036–2065). So we’ll soon be suffering through even worse heat waves than we are now seeing — and our children will see even more devastating ones.The NCA scientists explain that to achieve the low-emissions scenario, not only does every nation — including the United States — have to meet its Paris climate pledge. But, we all also have to keep ratcheting down the targets “with continually increasing ambition” until global emissions of carbon pollution are near zero by century’s end.Current extreme heat waves — and the droughts and wildfires that accompany them — are already wreaking havoc on this country and the world.Tragically, Trump’s policies will make such heat waves simply the normal climate, bringing with it new monster heat waves and catastrophic impacts.	


On the heels of an explosive report from WPTV about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s work release privileges more than a decade ago, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office has announced that it will be investigating itself.Brad Edwards, an attorney representing women who say Epstein sexually abused them, said this week at press conference that Epstein used his work release privileges to engage in “improper sexual contact.”Epstein, you may have heard, was allowed to leave the jail for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week on work release at his office after securing a secretive non-prosecution agreement from former federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta’s office. Acosta, when taking questions at a press conference ahead of resigning from his Labor Secretary post, shifted blame from himself to the state for these work release privileges. “The work release was complete BS,” he said. Esptein was accused of sexually abusing dozens of young girls, but instead of being hit with federal charges that could have locked him up for life upon conviction, he pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor (Acosta admitted these girls were “victims” not “prostitutes”).In any event, Edwards’s claim that Epstein wasn’t really in jail and that he “engaged in very similar conduct to that which was described in the Palm Beach police report”–conduct that “was sexual in nature”–got news outlets digging some more. What WPTV came up with:Contact 5 went through 464 pages of deputy logs, which deputies working Epstein’s detail were required to keep.We saw they took him to his house at least nine times while he was on work release, and left him in his home unsupervised for up to three hours sometimes. Contact 5 is digging into these deputy logs because just this week, a lawyer representing some of Epstein’s victims claimed more than one woman was propositioned by Epstein while visiting him during work release hours at his office.Summary: convicted sex-offender who abused young girls was allowed to sit at home unsupervised for hours.That’s not all:Deputy logs show Epstein was escorted to his home by deputies at least 9 times. He sometimes spent two or three hours inside while a deputy provided/maintained/conducted security outside his home.On July 11, 2009 for example, a deputy wrote that he escorted Epstein to his house and “provided security to prevent unwelcome guest from entering his property.” He brought him back more than two hours later. That same deputy contacted his sergeant to “get some clarity of my duties and responsibilities while at the residence. He stated the function was to provide security.”Summary: Deputies escorted Epstein to his house multiple times, and were there to “provide security.” Teri Barbera, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office, told the news outlet that “Sex offenders are not allowed to go on work release,” adding “Epstein registered as a sex offender after he was released from jail.” (Huh? Convicted sex offenders can go free if they haven’t registered yet?)Deputies working security were reportedly ordered to wear plain clothes, ordered to “greet inmate Epstein upon his arrival,” and ordered to “follow [Epstein] into the office, and remain in the office with him at all times.”It should be noted that the Miami Herald reported in Nov. 2018 that a deputy who “worked Epstein’s [security] detail” said it wasn’t their job to keep an eye on what Esptein was doing at his office while out of jail. The visitor logs reportedly showed both male and female visitors:One deputy who often worked Epstein’s detail said that his assignment was to stay in a front reception room of Epstein’s office. Epstein was in a separate office — with the door closed — most of the day as he accepted visitors, both male and female, the deputies’ logs show.“It was not our job to monitor what he was doing in that office,’’ the deputy, now retired, told the Herald.Brad Edwards said that Epstein used these opportunities not for “some business arrangement” but for “improper sexual contact.”“Once there, he used his perfect master manipulation to turn the situation into something sexual,” Edwards added. “Not one of the individuals was a prostitute.”Well, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has launched an internal investigation.#BREAKING: @PBCountySheriff @RicBradshaw announces an internal investigation into the "Jeffrey Epstein matter." Our reporting yesterday told you Epstein was allowed to spend hours at home unsupervised during his work release. MORE HERE: https://t.co/Gzg4RF4aRv @WPTV pic.twitter.com/ceq5qgHwT0— Sam Smink (@samsminkWPTV) July 19, 2019The statement: “Today, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw ordered an Internal Affairs investigation into the Jeffery [sic] Epstein matter. Sheriff Bradshaw takes these matters very seriously and wants to determine if any actions taken by the deputies assigned to monitor Epstein during his work release program violated any agency rules and regulations, during the time he was on PBSO work release program. All aspects of the matter will be fully investigated to ensure total transparency and accountability.”Bradshaw’s bio shows that he was first elected sheriff in 2004, and that he has been re-elected ever since.U.S. District Judge Richard Berman on Thursday ordered Epstein to remain jailed ahead of trial on child sex-trafficking charges in New York. Berman wrote at one point that Epstein’s “alleged excessive attraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence or minor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and young women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable.”[Image via CBS News screengrab]Matt Naham is managing editor of Law&Crime.

As wisely and eloquently stated by English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton in his 1839 play, Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy, “the pen is mightier than the sword,” this adage holds that the written word is a powerful tool in the transmission of ideas. Why else would oppressive regimes and other ruthless upholders of the status quo engage in censorship and book burning throughout the ages?For example, Pope Gregory IX in 1239, in his quest to maintain the Catholic Church’s economic and ideological stranglehold, ordered all copies of the Jewish holy book, the Talmud confiscated, and one of his successors, Pope John XXI, commanded that the Talmud be burned on the eve of the Jewish Passover in 1322.The Christian “reformer,” Martin Luther, in his 1526 treatise On the Jews and Their Lies, argued:“First, their synagogues should be set on fire.” Jewish prayer books should be destroyed, and rabbis forbidden to preach. The homes of Jews should likewise be “smashed and destroyed” and their residents “put under one roof or in a stable like gypsies, to teach them they are not master in our land….These poisonous envenomed worms should be drafted into forced labor. The young and strong Jews and Jewesses should be given the flail, the ax, the hoe, the spade, the distaff, and the spindle and let them earn their bread by the sweat of their noses.”As Luther’s dire pronouncement make perfectly clear, what begins as torching of books and other property eventually results in the denial of civil liberties, torture, and eventually murder of people scapegoated by the dominant social groups and by their governmental leaders.Related: Armed Trump supporter detained by police after bursting into library to protest drag queen storytimeThis was certainly the case in Nazi Germany. In 1933, Nazi storm troopers invaded, ransacked, and closed The Institute for Sexual Sciences in Berlin, founded by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a Jewish and homosexual sexuality researcher. The Institute conducted early sexuality research, the precursor of the Indiana-based Kinsey Institute in the United States.Storm troopers carried away and torched over 10,000 volumes of books and research documents calling the Institute “an international center of the white-slave trade” and “an unparalleled breading ground of dirt and filth.”Soon thereafter, Nazis and conservative university students throughout Germany invaded Jewish organizations, and public and school libraries and confiscated books they deemed “un-German.”The German Student Association declared a national “Action against the Un-German Spirit.” On May 10, 1933, the students along with Nazi leaders set ablaze over 25,000 volumes in Berlin’s Opernplatz. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, “fired” up the crowd of over 40,000 sympathizers by declaring, “No to decadence and moral corruption. Yes to decency and morality in family and state.”More recently in the United States, Pastor Terry Jones of the misnamed Dove World Outreach Center, a non-denominational church in Gainesville, Florida, called for an “International Burn a Quran Day,” September 11, 2010, the ninth anniversary of the attacks.Talking to CNN’s Rick Sanchez, Jones declared: “We believe that Islam is of the devil, that it’s causing billions of people to go to hell, it is a deceptive religion, it is a violent religion and that is proven many, many times.” Jones is also the author of the book, Islam Is of the Devil.This policy and action are offensive to all of us who believe in religious liberty. To stereotype and scapegoat all followers of Islam for the events of 9/11 is as invalid as blaming all Christians for the despicable actions perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber who was a devout Christian.Now we witness reports of anti-LGBTQ Christian crusader, Paul Dorr – founder of Rescue the Perishing, a group “contending against moral evil to advance the Kingdom of Christ” – who checked out four LGBTQ-inclusive children’s books from the Orange City, Iowa Public Library and torched them in a 27-minute October 2018 video diatribe over Facebook.The books in question were Two Boys Kissing, by David Levithan; Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress, by Christine Baldacchino; This Day In June, by Gayle E. Pitman; and Families, Families, Families!, by Suzanne and Max Lang.In his Facebook video rant, Dorr argued that Two Boys Kissing was “designed to get 12-to-13-year-old boys to start having homosexual sex together.”Recently, an Iowa court judge refused to drop all charges filed against Dorr over his claims of exercising his rights to freedom of speech.It is no mere overstatement to place Pastor Terry Jones and Paul Dorr’s actions within the context of book burning through the centuries. For as Santayana reminds us: “Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”The President made clear that there are no moral limits and he will keep going lower and lower until he high-fives Satan.Lindsey Graham was always a jerk, but he wasn’t a toady. He went from denouncing McCarthyism to soaking in it.And the hate group One Million Moms is partially responsible for our pain.How many people of color have been told to “go back home to your country,” even though they were born in the United States and have lived here all their lives?Kirchick thinks that racism isn’t a gay issue, that we should be okay with denying services to gay people and that Trump is friendly to us. Ughhhhh…From the Affordable Care Act to marriage equality, the fight for justice that sprang out of Stonewall is wide ranging and interconnected.I was a closeted gay student at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis. Now, I am an openly gay professor of religion and LGBTQ politics.Since when is a cross not a Christian symbol?When LGBTQ activist Edafe Okporo arrived at JFK airport, he didn’t know anyone in the US. Now he runs RDJ Refugee Shelter, providing homeless asylum seekers with temporary housing. And on World Refugee Day he’s telling his story.


At the top of his Wednesday night program, Fox News host Tucker Carlson apprised viewers that the usual script was getting tossed. “The President is speaking to supporters in Greenville, North Carolina. We will be taking portions of it live, especially the newsworthy moments,” said Carlson, as if the network’s producers could predict newsworthiness. “Right now, he is talking about the four radical freshman Democrats, Antifa, and more broadly, the direction the Democrats are moving. We are going to go back and listen in. It’s interesting.”The “listen in” strategy sure did vacuum up a newsworthy utterance from President Trump: “Better health care. And we’ll also always protect . . . you have to remember this. Are you ready? Because they give us a bum rap,” said Trump. “Patients with preexisting conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off.”As Trump was feeding those lines directly from Greenville to Fox News living rooms around the country, the other two main cable news networks were doing their own thing, together: On CNN, host Anderson Cooper was discussing Trump’s politics of hate; on MSNBC, host Chris Hayes was discussing Trump’s politics of hate. Both of these networks have learned the perils of running the live remarks of a liar.But Fox News? The more Trump lies, the better. And what a whopper they broadcast on preexisting conditions. Under the landmark health-care law passed during the Obama administration — the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare — "health insurance companies can’t refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a ‘pre-existing condition.’” The prohibition on discriminating against people with preexisting conditions — which is a lot of people — proved to be a helpful and popular reform.Perhaps that’s why the president sought to take credit for it. Falsely, of course. The truth of the situation couldn’t possibly have been more contrary to what he told his rally attendees and Fox News viewers: Republicans fought Obamacare as it bumped its way through Congress in the early years of the Obama administration, and they continued doing so for the balance of the Barack Obama’s two terms in office.These days, the Trump administration is backing a lawsuit that would invalidate Obamacare and its protections for preexisting conditions.For the balance of the hour, Carlson continued letting Trump set the agenda, sneaking in a segment about abortion and Planned Parenthood. Once the president finished his remarks, Carlson invited a commentator to marvel at Trump’s extraordinary political instincts.We’ve asked Fox News if the network ever set the record straight about the health-care lie; how it views these falsehood-filled rallies; and how to balance Trump’s words with fact-checking. We’ll update this post if we receive a response.Coverage of the Greenville rally focused on another newsworthy moment, when Trump criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar — a Somalia-born U.S. citizen and Democrat who represents Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District — the crowd in Greenville began chanting, “Send her back.” The focus on this un-American and racist moment only thickened on Thursday as Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, attempted to distance himself from a spectacle of his own making. "I was not happy with it,” he said. “I disagree with it.”The belated denial extends the shelf life of a story that began on Sunday, when Trump used Twitter to unleash racist attacks against Omar and three other first-term Democratic congresswomen of color. He instructed them to “go back” to their home countries, even though Omar is the only one of the four to have immigrated to the United States.Amid the quite justified furor over the president’s racism, there has been some attention on what is perhaps the most consequential policy lie of the Trump years. The Associated Press did a fact check rebutting Trump’s claim that Democrats couldn’t “pull it off” when it came to preexisting conditions. “Democrats did pull it off,” noted the fact-check. Speaking on CNN on Wednesday night, Daniel Dale, the network’s recently hired fact-checking ace, busted Trump: “This is extraordinarily false, Don,” said Dale, speaking to host Don Lemon. “This is like up-is-down stuff.” What’s more, noted Dale, Trump and his people have presented no plan in case preexisting conditions protections fall away via a pending federal lawsuit.But again, “send her back” has flooded the media zone.The lesson from the foregoing is a disheartening one. A president as prolific in the pursuits of dishonesty and racism and misogyny can generate more awfulness than even a well-staffed national press corps can monitor, contextualize and denounce. During the early days of the Trump White House, this blog asked whether Trump could outlast the media. Days like Thursday suggest the answer is “uh-huh” — with a lot of help and encouragement from Fox News.Read more:Eugene Robinson: George Wallace would have been proud of Trump’s latest rallyThe Post’s View: ‘The Squad’ hates Trump’s policies.

The group examined Facebook pages of 3,500 current and former officers at eight departments across the country, and its findings spurred internal investigations from Phoenix to Lake County, Fla.In Philadelphia, the Plain View Project identified some 3,100 offensive or potentially offensive posts from 328 active-duty police officers. Of that number, the most offensive were placed on leave while a department-hired law firm probed the matter, Commissioner Richard Ross said at a news conference. In addition to the officers that will be dismissed, four others will be suspended for a month.Their conduct, Ross said, “demonstrates the officers have little or no regard for their positions as police officers.”“I continue to be very disappointed and angered by these posts, many of which violate basic human decency,” Ross said. “We need to move past this ridiculous hate that has consumed this country and has done so for centuries.”The most egregious posts, he said, included Islamophobic cries such as “death to Islam,” references to African Americans as “thugs,” homophobic slurs, advocating violence against trans people and generally encouraging police brutality.“The posts were deeply disturbing,” said Mayor Jim Kenney. “Our police officers are entrusted to serve and protect the people of Philadelphia — everybody, all the people of Philadelphia.”The mayor and commissioner both pledged the city would do “better” going forward, and Ross announced a panoply of trainings that officers have already done or will undergo in the near future — including anti-bias and anti-racism workshops with input from the Anti-Defamation League. The department will also purchase or develop software that will allow officials to “data mine” officers’ social media accounts and flag hateful or harmful posts.John McNesby, president of the Philadelphia police union, said in a statement that the Fraternal Order of Police is “disappointed that our officers will be terminated without due process” but added that they “condemn racist and hateful speech in any form.”“We are currently meeting with each officer to prepare an appropriate response to protect our members’ rights under the contract,” he said. “The overwhelming majority of our members serve this city with integrity and professionalism.”McNesby has previously said that, while “there may have been a few” racist posts, “a lot of this stuff, though, I think is just cops being cops and venting.”Ross said the 13 officers, whom he did not name and who will be fired after a 30-day suspension, will probably be the last ones let go as part of this investigation, though he did say that officials were still looking into posts deemed less urgently offensive.The commissioner conceded that, even after the department punished its worst offenders, the episode inexorably frays relations between the police and the community.“We’ve made significant inroads, but this takes us back,” he said. “I’d be disingenuous if I didn’t acknowledge that.”Kenney defended his commissioner’s handling of the investigation and reaffirmed that he remains confident in Ross’s leadership of the department, which he has helmed for 2½ years.“I think people who have hate in their hearts have hate in their hearts,” Kenney said. “And I don’t think there’s anything they can do to get the hate out of their hearts other than fire them, discipline them and train them.”Read more: City plays ‘Baby Shark’ on loop to keep homeless from sleeping in waterfront parkA soldier was filmed cursing America and twisting a woman’s arm.

Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the conservative firebrand who has waged a tireless crusade to curtail immigration and voting rights in America, declined to say that he would not vote for President Donald Trump — even if Trump said explicitly: "I am a racist."Kobach, a vocal supporter of the president who is running for an open U.S. Senate in Kansas, said he's not sure if he would support Trump if he declared publicly that he is a racist."Um, I don't know. That would be a really tough question," Kobach said in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo."You'd have to think about it?" Cuomo fired back. "You have to think about whether or not you would support a racist?""I'd have to think about who was running against him," Kobach said.The exchange came after Kobach defended Trump's recent spate of racist comments directed at a group of newly-elected congresswomen of color. The White House and Democrats in Congress have been embroiled in a public feud since the president tweeted Sunday that a group of progressive congresswomen "who originally came from countries where governments are a complete and total catastrophe" should "go back and fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."Trump did not mention the lawmakers he was criticizing by name, but his comments were widely interpreted as targeting the four freshmen lawmakers who make up "The Squad" — Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. The four legislators are U.S. citizens and only Omar, who arrived in the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia, was born abroad."When the president said . . . that these members of Congress should go back to the crime-infested places from which they came, right?" Kobach told CNN. "Well, where are those places? Well, in AOC's case it's the Bronx; in Tlaib's case, it's Detroit; and in Omar's case, it's originally Somalia. Those are all crime-infested places and in Somalia's instance, there's terrorism, too. So it's a fact. To simply state that fact is not racist.""I let you get the argument out but, I'm just saying, it fails on its face," Cuomo interjected, noting that Trump did not say "places," but rather "countries," implying that three of the four lawmakers were not born in America.Cuomo went on to say that Trump took aim at those lawmakers "because they are brown," which prompted Kobach to argue that critics were misinterpreting the president's tweets because of the challenges posed by Twitter's character limit."That's the problem with Twitter. You're reading into it," Kobach said.But Trump continued to take aim at the lawmakers on and offline in recent days.He tweeted Tuesday that the four congresswomen "have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate" and stated his belief that Congress should take action on the "filthy language, statements and lies" allegedly shared by the lawmakers.He also accused the four congresswomen of being "anti-America" and said that the lawmakers could leave if they were unhappy with the state of things."If you hate our country — if you're not happy here, you can leave," the president said Monday outside the White House. "You can leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want. Don't come back — that's OK, too. But if you're not happy, you can leave."He also mentioned Omar by name, falsely claiming the congresswoman praised the terrorist organization al Qaeda while further accusing her of "hating Jews." Trump also brought up comments Omar made earlier this year about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which prompted immediate outrage from conservatives and spurred an increase in death threats against the congresswoman.Trump continued his verbal volleys at a campaign rally Wednesday evening in North Carolina, provoking the crowd at Greenville's East Carolina University to break out in chants of "send her back," aimed at Omar, even after the House of Representatives voted Tuesday on a resolution condemning the president over his comments.The resolution twice refers to "racist comments" by Trump but does not call the president a racist. It says the president's remarks have "legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color."Kobach, nevertheless, continued to defend the president, stating on CNN: "The reason President Trump wants to put the spotlight on them is because they are pushing socialism, they're pushing a radical left agenda, and as long as Americans are seeing them as the representatives of the Democrat Party then Republicans are winning."Kobach's unwavering defense of the president comes as he is vying for the Republican Party's nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by four-term GOP Sen. Pat Roberts. His bid faces an uphill battle from members of the GOP in the wake of his failed run for governor last year. Kobach, an outspoken Trump supporter, championed the president's anti-immigration agenda, going as far as to take credit for Trump's plans to "make Mexico pay for the wall."In 2017, Kobach headed Trump's now-defunct Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which uncovered no evidence to support the administration's claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. The commission was disbanded after many states refused Kobach's demand to hand over their confidential voter rolls to the federal government.Kobach is also a paid Breitbart News columnist, where he has articulated his hardline anti-immigration views. The Trump loyalist, who once accidentally leaked Homeland Security documents that revealed a plan to put Trump's hard-line immigration platform into practice, was reportedly under consideration as Secretary of Homeland Security. He also served as an adviser on immigration to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and has advocated for "self-deportation."Trump appears to hold the key to revive Kobach's political fortunes at a time when they appear to be a vanishing act.Watch Kobach's full interview with Cuomo here.

 "The EPA is endangering the lives of children to protect pesticide industry profits."Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler speaking in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)In a move environmentalists denounced as yet another case of the Trump administration putting industry profits over public health, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Thursday that it will not ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to brain damage in children."The EPA's refusal to ban chlorpyrifos ignores decades of science showing that this pesticide has irrevocable effects on human health and the environment."—Tiffany Finck-Haynes, Friends of the Earth"By allowing chlorpyrifos to stay in our fruits and vegetables, Trump's EPA is breaking the law and neglecting the overwhelming scientific evidence that this pesticide harms children's brains," Patti Goldman, attorney with Earthjustice said in a statement. "It is a tragedy that this administration sides with corporations instead of children's health."EPA chief Andrew Wheeler's decision to reject a petition by environmental groups calling for a ban on the neurotoxic chemical ignores the assessments of his agency's own scientists, said Tiffany Finck-Haynes, pesticides and pollinators program manager for Friends of the Earth."The EPA's refusal to ban chlorpyrifos ignores decades of science showing that this pesticide has irrevocable effects on human health and the environment," said Finck-Haynes. "The EPA is endangering the lives of children to protect pesticide industry profits."Today Trump's @EPA announced that it will not #BanChlorpyrifos — a brain-damaging pesticide that EPA's own scientists have deemed unsafe at any level."The EPA is endangering the lives of children to protect pesticide industry profits."https://t.co/gBUAaTT5wsChlorpyrifos has been banned for household use since 2000, but the pesticide is still used by farmers on "more than 50 fruit, nut, cereal, and vegetable crops," according to the New York Times."In 2016," the Times reported, "more than 640,000 acres were treated with chlorpyrifos in California alone."The Obama administration in 2015 proposed banning use of the pesticide on food crops, but former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt authorized its continued use in 2017."Until EPA gets this stuff out of our fields and off our food, this fight is not over." —Erik Olson, Natural Resources Defense Council"This is a total disgrace," Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) tweeted in response to the EPA's decision on Thursday.Finck-Haynes of Friends of the Earth said that as the federal government continues to work on behalf of chemical interests, states must take immediate action to protect the public and the environment."While the federal government refuses to act, we urge states to step in, ban chlorpyrifos, and demonstrate that they will safeguard public health and the environment," said Finck-Haynes. "We call on [New York] Governor [Andrew] Cuomo to sign the chlorpyrifos ban bill sitting on his desk and protect New Yorkers from this toxic pesticide."In a statement on Thursday, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) highlighted the Trump administration's ties to Dow Chemical, the largest producer of chlorpyrifos in the United States."The relationship between President Trump and Dow Chemical... has been called into question," the group said. "Among other things, the chemical manufacturing giant reportedly donated $1 million for Trump's inauguration, and its CEO previously played a chief advisory role to the president, heading up his now defunct American Manufacturing Council."Erik Olson, senior director of health and food at NRDC, said the effort to achieve a ban on chlorpyrifos will continue."Until EPA gets this stuff out of our fields and off our food," said Olson, "this fight is not over."Because of people like you, another world is possible.

Audience ratings certified by ACPM/OJDDate created : 19/07/2019 - 14:34Jerusalem (AFP)An Israeli spyware firm thought to have hacked WhatsApp in the past has told clients it can scoop user data from the world's top social media, the Financial Times reported Friday.The London paper wrote that NSO group had "told buyers its technology can surreptitiously scrape all of an individual?s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, according to people familiar with its sales pitch".An NSO spokesperson, responding in a written statement to AFP's request for comment, denied the allegation."There is a fundamental misunderstanding of NSO, its services and technology," it said. "NSO?s products do not provide the type of collection capabilities and access to cloud applications, services, or infrastructure as listed and suggested in today?s FT article."In May, Facebook-owned WhatsApp said it had released an update to plug a security hole in its messaging app that allowed insertion of sophisticated spyware that could be used to spy on journalists, activists and others.It said the attack bore "all the hallmarks of a private company that works with a number of governments around the world".It did not name a suspect but Washington-based analyst Joseph Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said at the time that the hack appeared related to the NSO's Pegasus software.It is normally sold to law enforcement and intelligence services.Friday's FT report, citing documents it had viewed and descriptions of a product demonstration, said the programme had "evolved to capture the much greater trove of information stored beyond the phone in the cloud, such as a full history of a target?s location data, archived messages or photos".NSO says it does not operate the Pegasus system, only licensing it to closely vetted government users "for the sole purpose of preventing or investigating serious crime including terrorism".The group came under the spotlight in 2016 when researchers accused it of helping spy on an activist in the United Arab Emirates. NSO is based in the Israeli seaside hi-tech hub of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv. It says it employs 600 people in Israel and around the world.Pegasus is a highly invasive tool that can reportedly switch on a target's cell phone camera and microphone, and access data on it, effectively turning the phone into a pocket spy."Increasingly sophisticated terrorists and criminals are taking advantage of encrypted technologies to plan and conceal their crimes, leaving intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the dark and putting public safety and national security at risk," the company statement said."NSO?s lawful interception products are designed to confront this challenge." © 2019 AFPThe page no longer exists or did not exist at all.

												Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Thursday blasted Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s life sentence as “inhumane” — echoing comments made by the convicted druglord himself.“A sentence for life in a hostile jail” would be “hard” and not worth living, said López Obrador at a morning press conference, according to Reuters.He did, however, call Guzman out for his murderous ways and drug-fueled life of crime.“It’s something very painful,” said López Obrador, adding that had “many victims in mind.”Guzman will spend the rest of his life in Colorado’s supermax prison after being convicted in February on an array of drug-trafficking charges.Ahead of his sentencing this week, the Sinaloa Cartel leader claimed his incarceration was “physical, emotional and mental torture” — and “the most inhumane situation” he had ever experienced in his “entire life.”López Obrador told reporters on Thursday that he hoped Guzman’s sentence — while harsh — would lead to less violence in Mexico.“We think that bit by bit the number of criminal incidents will decline,” he said. “We will continue to create a better society, supported by values, that is not based on accumulating material wealth, money or luxury.”With Post wires
